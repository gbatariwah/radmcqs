        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "Slightly more hydrogen nuclei align parallel (‘spin up’) than antiparallel (‘spin down’), giving rise to the net longitudinal magnetization MZ. The difference between protons with parallel and antiparallel alignment is only 3 per million in a 1 T static magnetic field. This can be increased using special techniques (hyperpolarization)."
      },
      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Protons align with the external field, but precess with different phases, cancelling each other’s transverse magnetization. Therefore, the resulting net transverse magnetization (MXY) is zero. Their phases are synchronized (‘phase coherence’) by an external 90 degrees radiofrequency pulse whose frequency is equal to the Larmor frequency."
      },
      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "This is the precessional frequency in a 1 T magnetic field. At 1.5 T, it would be proportionally higher, i.e. 63.9 MHz."

        "answer": "False",

        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Dephasing occurs due to spin–spin interactions (T 2 ) and local magnetic field inhomogeneities. Spin–lattice (or T 1 ) relaxation is responsible for realignment of magnetic dipoles with the external magnetic field."

      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "The TE is always double the time between the initial 90 degrees and the 180 degrees refocusing pulse. In order to obtain signals at different TEs, the timing between the radiofrequency pulses must be changed accordingly."
      },
      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Multiple refocusing 180 degrees pulses can be applied following one excitation, and multiple echoes (albeit of decreasing amplitude due to T 2 relaxation) can be obtained. This is the basis of fast (turbo) spin–echo sequences."

        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "T1 weighting is obtained with a short TR, usually between 300 and 800 ms (close to the T 1 s of the tissues being imaged). With increasing TR, the longitudinal magnetization in all tissues would recover more, diminishing the T1 contrast. Short TEs are used to reduce the effect of T 2 relaxation on contrast (see below)."

        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Relatively long TEs (90–140 ms, close to the T2 s of the tissues being imaged) are used so measurable differences in the degree of transverse magnetization can develop. With short TEs, these differences are small; therefore, short TEs reduce the effect of T2 weighing. Long TRs are used to allow near-full recovery of longitudinal magnetization and eliminate differences in contrast due to T1 ."

      {
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "As described above, a short TE and long TR reduce the effect of T 2 and T 1 , respectively. The remaining contrast is only dependent on the density of hydrogen nuclei (PD weighted)."

        "answer": "True",

      },
      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "On fast spin–echo images, fat appears hyperintense. This results from the multiple refocusing pulses, which suppress a phenomenon known as J-coupling (an interaction between different nuclei within the fat molecules), resulting in fat having a longer T2 and therefore appearing brighter."

      },
      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Water has a long T 1 and T 2 ; therefore, it appears hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2 sequences. This makes T2 sequences sensitive for pathology, as most pathological processes (e.g. oedema, tumour, infarction) are associated with increased tissue water content."
      },
      {
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "Grey matter has slightly longer T 1 and T 2 relaxation times than white matter, and so is darker on T1 and brighter on T2 sequences. The way to remember this is that grey matter is ‘grey’ on the sequence that better shows anatomy (T 1-weighted)."

        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "If possible, phase encoding should be applied along the shorter dimension of the imaged object (i.e. lateral in head imaging, antero-posterior in abdominal imaging). This potentially allows a smaller number of phase-encoding steps (reduced-phase field of view) and minimizes the risk of aliasing artefacts."

      },
      {
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "This is because the slice-selection gradient causes a phase shift along its direction arising during the second half of the gradient (after the magnetization is tipped into the transverse plane by the 90 degrees pulse). This phase shift needs to be undone by an additional rephasing gradient with a reversed polarity and at half the area of the slice-selection gradient."

        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "This would transform into a sinusoidal signal modulation seen as parallel dark and bright lines with a periodicity dependent on the distance of the abnormal pixel from the k-space centre (the further from the centre, the higher the spatial frequency of the lines). This is often termed a ‘herringbone’ or ‘corduroy’ artefact, and may, for example, result from high-intensity radiofrequency spike noise originating from within the MRI room."
      },

        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "It is sufficient to acquire just over one-half of the k-space. The missing part may be filled with zeros – this is known as zero filling and results in a blurry image. Alternatively, as k-space is symmetrical, the acquired half may be ‘mirrored’ (with appropriate mathematical corrections) into the missing half and the image reconstructed without loss of spatial resolution but with a decreased signal-to-noise ratio. This is sometimes known as half or fractional NEX (number of excitations) imaging."

The number of successive echoes (the echo train length or ETL) in extreme cases may equal the number of required phase-encoding steps, allowing acquisition of the entire image after a single 90 degrees  pulse (single-shot FSE). Acquisition can be accelerated further by using partial k-space filling (e.g. half-Fourier single-shot turbo spin–echo or HASTE)."

        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "Each echo in the train is acquired at increasing times from the 90 degrees  excitation pulse. The amplitude of each phase-encoding gradient is chosen such that the echoes nearest in time to the desired user-selected ‘effective echo time (TE)’ are placed in the centre of k-space (with the lowest amplitude of the phase-encoding gradient). The image contrast is therefore weighted to this ‘effective TE’. Assuming a long repetition time (TR), if the centre of k-space is filled with the early echoes, then the effective TE is short and the image is proton density (PD) weighted. If the centre is filled with later echoes, then the effective TE is long and the images are T2 weighted."
      },

        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "In single-shot FSE sequences, all the k-space data are acquired from a single 90 degrees  excitation pulse and a long train of refocusing pulses. If the echoes at the end of the train are used to fill the centre of the k-space, then the images become heavily T 2 weighted. In the abdomen, only tissues with long T 2 relaxation times will remain visible, i.e. fluid-filled structures such as the bile ducts, as the signal from other tissues will have decayed away. Other applications include uro-MRI and small-bowel MRI."

A prephasing gradient is used initially to dephase the spins, followed by the standard frequency-encoding gradient of the opposite polarity, which rephases the spins. Rephasing (and therefore signal amplitude) is maximal in the middle of the frequency-encoding gradient."

The resulting signal is proportional to the ratio of T 2/T 1 ; therefore, water is hyperintense on these sequences, making them perfectly suited to these types of imaging. Other uses include 3D and breath-hold imaging. Examples of such sequences are GRE, FISP (fast imaging with steady-state precession) and FFE."

      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Diffusion weighting is achieved by applying a pair of diffusion-encoding gradients on either side of the 180 degrees  pulse in a spin–echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence. It is generally necessary to apply the diffusion gradients separately on all three orthogonal axes in order to eliminate effects due to diffusion anisotropy."
      },
      {
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "The effect of the diffusion gradients is to reduce the overall image intensity due to irreversible signal loss caused by spins diffusing in the presence of the two diffusion gradients. In regions of restricted diffusion, such as cytotoxic oedema secondary to a stroke, the distance the spins can diffuse is reduced and hence the signal loss is not as great, resulting in regions of relative hyperintensity compared with normal tissue."
      },
      {
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "The requirement for the large (high amplitude and long duration) diffusion gradients increases the effective echo time (TE) making the DW-MRI T2 weighted. Therefore the high signal of water may sometimes be misinterpreted as restricted diffusion. Calculation of an apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map can eliminate the effect of this T2 shine-through."
      },
      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Areas of restricted diffusion on an ADC map are hypointense. The ADC map is calculated from two diffusion sequences obtained with different b-values, and is independent of T2 ."
      },
      {
        "answer": "True",

      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Washout of blood from the slice between the 90 degrees  and 180 degrees  pulses in spin–echo imaging causes signal loss because the blood will not have experienced both the 90 degrees  and 180 degrees  pulses in order to produce a spin echo. In gradient-echo imaging, only one radiofrequency pulse is required for signal formation so there is no washout phenomenon."
      },
      {
        "answer": "True",
        "explanation": "This is because the inflowing fresh blood has full longitudinal magnetization, which will produce a high signal compared with the stationary background tissue."
      },
      {
        "answer": "False",
        "explanation": "Any tissue that has a short T 1 can appear bright on T1 -weighted gradient-echo imaging. It is therefore possible that blood breakdown products such as methaemoglobin could give a bright intraluminal signal that could be misinterpreted as blood flowing in a patent vessel."
      },

When the metabolic activity of the brain increases, there is a slight increase in deoxyhaemoglobin production but a disproportionately larger increase in blood flow (due to neurovascular coupling) carrying oxyhaemoglobin. The net effect is an increase in MR signal on T2*-weighted sequences due to the increase in diamagnetic oxyhaemoglobin over the resting-state level of paramagnetic deoxyhaemoglobin."
