    "explanation": "18F-FDG PET/CT scan is used to help differentiate benign from malignant pleural thickening and can also help to assess for nodal metastases in malignant mesothelioma. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is not typically used for this indication. CT abdomen and pelvis would be more appropriate once malignancy was confirmed to exclude peritoneal involvement. On MRI, high T2 signal intensity when compared to muscle, and contrast enhancement of the pleural thickening is suggestive of malignancy; however, this patient has a pacemaker which would likely contraindicate MRI. MRI is sometimes used in the staging of malignant mesothelioma, particularly where there is a question regarding surgical resection and the extent of chest wall or diaphragmatic involvement. Portal venous phase contrast CT chest is better at demonstrating pleural enhancement than an arterial phase CT; however, 18F-FDG PET/CT is more sensitive for distinguishing between malignant and benign disease. CT features that favour a malignant process include pleural thickness >1 cm, nodularity and mediastinal pleural involvement.",

    "explanation": "Haemochromatosis causes a symmetrical arthropathy typically affecting the second and third metacarpal phalangeal joints causing osteopenia, reduction in joint space, subchondral cysts, flattening of the metacarpal heads and ‘hook-like’ osteophytes. Chondrocalcification is common and overlaps with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease. Haemochromatosis is associated with iron deposition in the liver, spleen, heart, pancreas and central nervous system, causing low signal on T1, T2 and T2* MRI sequences. A dilated oesophagus would be associated with scleroderma – acro-osteolysis causing ‘pencil-in-cup’ deformities; soft tissue atrophy and calcification and contractures are also features. There is often marked ulnar deviation of the phalanges. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes symmetrical muscle wasting, periarticular osteopenia and reversible deformities such as ‘swan-neck’ deformities and ulnar deviation. SLE is associated with hypercoagulability, and patients are at risk of venous thrombosis which could manifest as intracranial venous sinus hyperdensity. Multiple small foci of subcortical T2* low signal on MRI head are typical of microhaemorrhages in amyloidosis. Larger joints tend to be affected rather than the hands, and features include subchondral cysts, erosions and osteoporosis without joint space narrowing. Soft tissue deposition of amyloid can lead to periarticular nodularity. Sarcoidosis causes symmetrical hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The musculoskeletal manifestations include a typical ‘lace-like’ appearance along with soft tissue swelling, cyst formation and resorption of the terminal tufts.",

    "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is metastatic adenocarcinoma. Metastases to the adrenal gland can be large with a heterogeneous appearance, central necrosis, haemorrhage and irregular borders. The most common sites of primary malignancy are lung, breast, melanoma, gastrointestinal tract and renal. The main differential diagnosis is adrenocortical carcinoma. This has peak incidences in early childhood and in the fourth and fifth decade of life. This tumour is usually large at diagnosis and typically has central necrosis or haemorrhage. There is calcification in 30% and it can invade the inferior vena cava or the renal vein. However, adrenocortical carcinoma is relatively rare compared to metastatic adenocarcinoma. A collision tumour is a rare occurrence of two different pathologies in the same place and can be benign or malignant. There are no specific features described to indicate that lesion could be a myelolipoma, such as fat density or punctate calcification. A phaechromocytoma would usually demonstrate homogeneous enhancement. They are prone to haemorrhage and then can appear heterogeneous. Most are benign but some may be malignant and demonstrate metastases; however, this occurs less commonly than adenocarcinoma metastases.",

    "explanation": "The imaging characteristics of the lesions, along with abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy and mild splenomegaly, make lymphoma most likely. Lymphoma of the kidney can be split into primary and secondary forms. The primary form is uncommon because the kidneys do not contain lymphoid tissue. The secondary form occurs because of haematogenous spread and is most likely to be non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Unlike renal cell carcinoma (RCC), typically lymphoma does not significantly affect the renal contour. Lymphomas often look slightly denser compared to adjacent normal renal tissue prior to contrast and are comparatively hypodense to the rest of the kidney following contrast. The MRI appearances are usually intermediate T1 and intermediate to low T2 signal. Lymphoma is typically more homogenous in appearance compared to RCC. Vascular invasion is an important feature when evaluating renal masses; RCC and leiomyosarcoma are more likely to invade the vessels, whereas lymphoma can encase them. Metastases do not typically invade the vessels either and are usually small lesions and cortically based. The most common primaries which metastasise to the kidneys are melanoma, lung, colorectal and breast. No other primary site is identified on the CT, although a melanoma primary is unlikely to be radiologically visible. The patient is male, making breast malignancy unlikely. CT cannot exclude gastrointestinal malignancy, and endoscopy could be considered, although if there was disseminated colorectal cancer, liver and lung metastases would also be expected. Leiomyosarcomas spread haematogenously; therefore lymphadenopathy is uncommon and the lesions are often positioned close to the renal pelvis and vessels.",

    "explanation": "The description of multiple cutaneous nodules and the finding of bilateral internal cerebral artery (ICA) occlusion is suggestive of Moyamoya syndrome in the setting of neurofibromatosis (NF) 1. Two conditions containing the name Moyamoya exist − a disease and a syndrome. Moyamoya disease translates as ‘puff of smoke’ from Japanese and is a vasculo-occlusive angiopathy. The puff-of-smoke description arises from the appearance of the intracranial collateralisation that occurs secondary to congenital stenosis and occlusion of the distal ICAs; however, it can affect other vessels within the circle of Willis too. On imaging there are commonly watershed infarcts and it may present with intraventricular haemorrhage. Moyamoya syndrome gives the same appearance on angiography but is not the result of a congenital ICA occlusion. It is associated with NF1, sickle cell, radiation, chronic infection, tuberculosis and atherosclerosis.",

    "explanation": "The imaging features described are typical for reperfusion syndrome. This occurs in 95% of transplant patients within 48 hours of the procedure. It is non-cardiogenic oedema and is seen radiographically as bilateral perihilar airspace opacification and can occur alongside bibasal effusions. It resolves by day 10; persistence after this time is suggestive of infection or acute rejection. Acute transplant rejection usually occurs 10 days after transplant. Chest radiographs are normal in 50% of patients but there may be heterogeneous perihilar opacification, septal thickening and a pleural effusion. Diagnosis can be made by transbronchial biopsy. The imaging appearances of bronchiolitis obliterans are of bronchiectasis and air trapping, and this condition usually occurs 6–18 months after transplant. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease represents a proliferative disorder occurring from 1 month onwards. It manifests as lung nodules and adenopathy. The clinical scenario and imaging findings in this case are not in keeping with this. Infection can occur at any time and is the most common complication after transplantation; however reperfusion syndrome is the most common immediate complication and the imaging features described in the stem are in keeping with this condition.",

Duodenal ulcers are most commonly more proximally in the bulbar part of the duodenum and are also more commonly anteriorly rather than posteriorly positioned. An adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater would be positioned laterally, expected to have ill-defined edges and may lead to obstruction.

The cerebellum is usually not affected. Pachygyria (broad gyri) and agyria (no gyri) also exist as subtypes within this spectrum of disorders. Schizencephaly is a cleft lined by grey matter extending between the pia mater and ependymal surface and often connecting the surface of the brain to the lateral ventricles. The open-lipped subtype has cerebrospinal fluid in the cleft and the closed lip subtype does not. Porencephaly occurs secondary to an in-utero insult, usually before the second trimester. It leaves a fluid-filled space communicating with the ventricles lined by white matter. Holoprosencephaly is incomplete septation of the two cerebral hemispheres. Hemimegalencephaly is when part of the brain is enlarged due to hamartomatous overgrowth; this can be an entire hemisphere or more limited.",

In contrast to this, odontogenic keratocysts often enhance poorly. Ameloblastomas are commonly expansile and can cause root resorption. Metastases are an important differential in this age group; however they usually have more ill-defined margins.

    "explanation": "The ongoing pneumothorax and bubbling chest drain are suspicious for a bronchopleural fistula. They can occur following surgery or as a sequelae of chemo- or radiotherapy and also sometimes with infections, such as tuberculosis. CT can often be used to diagnose this condition; however, in this case when further clarification is required, a Xenon ventilation study can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating tracer activity in the pleural space. A CT pulmonary angiogram and a ventilation perfusion (VQ) study would not add anything further to the existing CT chest for this indication and would be more appropriate if pulmonary embolus was suspected. Inserting a larger bore chest drain is unlikely to clinically improve the situation and would not aid diagnosis. Larger bore chest drains can be indicated in the context of pleural effusions with thick fluid, for example empyema or haemothorax. Removing the chest drain when there is suspicion of a bronchopleural fistula could potentially lead to tension pneumothorax and therefore this is not an appropriate management plan.",

    "explanation": "Fibrolamellar HCC is an uncommon variant of HCC affecting young patients with no risk factors. The tumour is typically large at diagnosis. The central scar is usually hyperechoic on ultrasound and hypointense on MRI sequences, which helps to differentiate it from the T2 hyperintense central scar in focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). The central scar generally does not enhance in fibrolamellar HCC but does in FNH. The age of the patient in this case is highly suggestive of fibrolamellar HCC over standard HCC. Fibrolamellar HCC can calcify; however this is less likely in HCC. Furthermore, fibrolamellar HCC is commonly isointense on venous phase imaging, whereas HCC shows early washout. Hepatic adenoma can occur in a similar age group; however they do not contain a central scar. They frequently contain fat and haemorrhage. The former leads to a drop of signal on out-of-phase imaging. Haemangiomas can appear hyperechoic on ultrasound but their enhancement is quite characteristic with peripheral enhancement that progresses centrally with time. They do not contain a central scar.",

    "explanation": "The imaging appearances are consistent with medullary sponge kidney. On intravenous urograms the appearance used to be likened to a paintbrush; otherwise known as a ‘striated nephrogram’. Other causes for this appearance bilaterally include acute pyelonephritis, acute tubular necrosis, hypotension and autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease. The latter is associated with paediatric patients. The history does not fit with hypotension, acute pyelonephritis or acute tubular necrosis. Urine dip would typically be abnormal in pyelonephritis and acute tubular necrosis, either showing signs of nitrites, blood or protein. If these conditions were suspected clinically, then answers B and D may be appropriate. If systemic lupus erythematous is suspected then an antinuclear antibody test would be helpful; however, this tends to be associated with glomerulonephritis, which causes swollen kidneys. Renal vein thrombosis would cause a unilateral striated nephrogram and is also unlikely in a patient without risk factors; therefore an ultrasound Doppler is unlikely to provide any additional information. Medullary sponge kidney does not progress to renal failure, and for most patients the condition is asymptomatic. It is often picked up incidentally and further follow-up is not required.",

The radiographic appearance in the case is called the ‘double bubble’ sign. The majority of cases have an obstructive level which is just distal to the ampulla of Vater and hence the vomiting is bilious. Non-bilious vomiting would suggest a more proximal obstruction. The finding that there is no gas more distally in the bowel excludes other differentials such as duodenal stenosis or a duodenal web.

The history may fit with manganese poisoning, which causes parkinsonism; however the area of the brain affected is different, with T1 hyperintensity in the globus pallidi. Similarly the globus pallidi are affected in carbon monoxide poisoning; however, the history is not consistent. Imaging findings in Alzheimer’s and Lewy body dementia can be non-specific and they require clinical correlation. The typical description in Alzheimer’s disease is mesial temporal lobe volume loss and volume loss in the parietal-occipital region.

Lung, breast, ovarian and lymphoma are the most common malignancies to metastasise to the pleura. Pleural mesothelioma is the second most common pleural malignancy (after metastases), strongly associated with exposure to asbestos and a latency period of up to 40 years. Primary pleural lymphoma is extremely rare. When it occurs, it tends to be associated with immunodeficiency and chronic pyothorax. Secondary pleural lymphoma is more common than primary pleural lymphoma. Liposarcoma of the pleura is demonstrated as a mixed attenuation mass with some areas of fat tissue (this is a different entity to liposarcomatous differentiation of malignant mesothelioma). Fibrothorax is a benign entity that can occur as a sequelae to inflammation, tuberculosis or haemothorax.

    "explanation": "Modic endplate changes are associated with degenerative disease of the lumbar spine. Type II changes are most common. The difference between Modic type I changes and discitis is the disc signal. Normally discs are intermediate signal or, if there is disc dehydration, they may demonstrate low T2 signal, whereas in discitis they would be high on T2 and low signal on T1 sequences, due to inflammation. Answer A would be consistent with discitis. Modic type I is associated with pain and due to bone marrow oedema, and inflammation there is increased fluid in the region, hence T1 endplate signal is low and T2 endplate signal is high. Answer C would be consistent with Modic type I change. Modic type II changes are due to red marrow replacement, which is fatty; hence T1 endplate signal is high, as is T2 signal. Modic type III changes are due to subsequent sclerosis and so both T1 and T2 endplate signals are low. Answer D would be consistent with Modic type III change.",

The torcular herophili (the confluence of the intracranial venous sinuses) is abnormally elevated. The variant condition is when not all of the findings are present and often the posterior fossa is not enlarged. If there is a posterior fossa cerebrospinal fluid cyst and the cerebellar vermis are normal in appearance, then the differential lies between arachnoid cyst and mega cisterna magna. The latter is a normal variant. An arachnoid cyst is suspected if there is adjacent mass effect. Chiari malformations do not cause an enlarged posterior fossa. Chiari I is when the cerebellar tonsils descend >5 mm through the foramen magnum. Chiari II is more severe and can cause a small posterior fossa and descent of the torcular herophili.

However, gadolinium-based contrast agent is avoided in pregnancy unless essential for diagnosis and management. An unenhanced MRI may still be helpful and is worth pursuing in the first instance. MRI should be avoided in the first trimester, and then in the second and third trimesters it is worth considering whether acoustic noise and specific absorption rate (SAR) can be reduced by amending the protocol.

CT changes include bilateral consolidation and ground glass opacification with pleural effusions and interlobular septal thickening. In contrast to the chronic and simple subtypes of eosinophilic lung disease, the acute form is not associated with serum eosinophilia and instead there are elevated eosinophil levels in the bronchoalveolar fluid. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Churg-Strauss) can have ground glass opacification and consolidation but you may also expect centrilobular nodularity and serum eosinophilia. Sarcoidosis is also associated with nodularity, and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is also common. Pleural effusions are not typical. Bronchopneumonia can cause bilateral scattered consolidation with Staphylococcus aureus infection potentially leading to cavitating pneumonia and empyema; however, in a young patient the full blood count would usually be abnormal.

Sometimes, similar to this case, they can present with haemorrhage. The most common site is the stomach, followed by the small intestine. They are usually benign but larger tumours, greater than 5 cm, are more likely to have malignant potential. Ninety percent of GISTs express c-KIT (CD117) antigen, a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor. GISTs can be associated with several syndromes, including neurofibromatosis type I. The intracranial appearances are consistent with this – sphenoid wing dysplasia and focal areas of signal intensity (FASIs). Carney triad is also associated with GISTs.

    "explanation": "The imaging description is of a heterogenous renal lesion with coarse calcification and a central scar. The differential lies between renal cell carcinoma and oncocytoma. Classical imaging characteristics for an oncocytoma include an isoechoic renal mass with a hypoechoic centre on ultrasound. CT of larger lesions such as this one can demonstrate a heterogenous mass and there can be perinephric fat stranding. Both CT and MRI demonstrate the typical non-enhancing central scar. Other MRI features include T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity compared to the renal cortex. In this case an MRI is unlikely to add more information. Oncocytomas are benign but they are difficult to differentiate from renal cell carcinoma on imaging alone, and even a biopsy of a carcinoma can contain oncocytic components. Renal sarcomas are aggressive lesions. Often at this size there may be vascular invasion, and early haematogenous metastases are common. The CT scan on this patient does not demonstrate evidence of metastatic infiltration. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is surgical resection to help confirm what the lesion is and plan for the most appropriate management.

Cutaneous melanoma can also metastasise to the eye, along with other primary tumours such as breast and lung. Typically ocular melanoma is hyperdense on CT with a lenticular, well-defined shape. The mass enhances and demonstrates high T1 and low T2 signal due to melanin content. There may be haemorrhage associated with it. Drusen are usually small areas of bilateral calcification overlying the optic nerve and are not a unilateral finding, such as in this case. Choroidal osteomas do occur unilaterally and manifest as curvilinear calcification which are usually larger than drusen and normally spare the optic disc.

    "explanation": "Basal lung fibrosis, pectus excavatum, posterior vertebral scalloping and ribbon ribs are all thoracic manifestations of neurofibromatosis (NF) type 1 (von Recklinghausen disease). This is the genetic condition described in the main stem. The cutaneous nodules seen on the plain film represent cutaneous neurofibromas. The posterior mediastinal mass described could represent a meningocele or neurofibroma (fluid content would favour meningocele). Posterior scalloping of the vertebral bodies and ribbon ribs can occur secondary to adjacent neurofibroma. Pectus excavatum is sometimes associated with other conditions including Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. It can be seen on plain film as blurring of the right heart border and displacement to the left, mimicking middle lobe consolidation. The posterior ribs are also more horizontal and the anterior ribs are more vertical. Tracheobronchomegaly is not a feature of NF 1.",

    "explanation": "In childhood red (haematopoietic) marrow predominates in the skeleton but as we age this is converted, distally to proximally, to yellow (fatty) marrow. In adulthood only the axial skeleton continues to contain red marrow. Some conditions promote the reconversion of yellow to red marrow, including conditions associated with anaemia, long distance running and altitude. Signal characteristics of yellow marrow follow subcutaneous fat on all sequences, demonstrating high signal on T1 and T2 sequences. Red marrow is mildly hyperintense on T2 sequences but although on T1 imaging will be hyperintense to disc and muscle, it can be comparatively lower than the T2 signal and can be difficult to differentiate from metastatic marrow infiltration. In- and out-of-phase imaging can be helpful as the fat in yellow marrow will cause a drop in signal on the out-of-phase sequence which will not occur in metastatic infiltration. Haemosiderosis may be possible in this case due to episodes of haemolysis or potentially repeated transfusion but it would be expected to cause reduced T1 and T2 signal. Myelofibrosis is unlikely in this case but causes low signal on T1 and T2 sequences.",

    "explanation": "An astrocytoma is the most common posterior fossa mass, but the radiological features of this mass favour medulloblastoma, which is the second most common. Medulloblastomas are solid masses which can grow quickly causing a relatively rapid onset of symptoms. They typically have low T1 signal and are T2 iso/hyperintense to grey matter. They are commonly more homogenous than other posterior fossa masses and demonstrate both enhancement and restricted diffusion. They arise from the roof of the fourth ventricle. It is important to image the rest of the neuroaxis to exclude drop metastases. Astrocytomas typically have a large cystic component with an enhancing mural nodule. The fourth ventricle is often displaced anteriorly. Ependymomas are frequently also in the fourth ventricle; however, they arise from the floor of the fourth ventricle and can extend out of the foramen of Magendie and Luschka. They are more heterogenous and commonly calcify. Brainstem glioma tend to occur in the pons causing diffuse enlargement, although they can sometimes cause an exophytic masses. Like medulloblastoma, they can return low T1 and high T2 signal; however, their enhancement and restricted diffusion is minimal in comparison. Paediatric choroid plexus papilloma are more common in the lateral ventricles and are usually well-defined cauliflower-like masses rather than the ill-defined mass described in this child.",

There are various associations with tethered cord including spinal lipoma, diastematomyelia, thickened filum terminale, Chiari malformation, myelomeningocele and dermal sinus. In this case, the cord is tethered due to a lipoma; it follows fat on all sequences and does not enhance. Ependymoma and paraganglioma are other causes of filum terminale masses. Ependymomas are the most common but they are often more heterogenous than the mass described in this question with haemorrhage, cystic change and calcification. Paragangliomas are also usually more heterogenous and they also intensely enhance. Lipomyelomeningocele is a form of spina bifida. Although they do contain fat, it extends within the subcutaneous tissues and there are other important features such as neural arch defects. The bones in this case are normal.

In contrast to this, serous cystadenomas should be simple and cystic with no soft tissue component. Mucinous cystadenomas often have multiple septations, and due to their mucin content may have more varied signal than a serous cystadenoma. The lesion is frequently described as having a ‘stained glass’ appearance on MRI. A mucinous cystadenocarcinoma would have these features but also suspicious findings such as mural thickening or solid components.

    "explanation": "Capillary haemangiomas often affect the periorbital region and are also called strawberry haemangiomas when they are external on the skin surface. However, they can cause intraorbital masses presenting with proptosis. They usually increase in size over the first few months of life and then slowly regress. On imaging they appear as lobulated, septated masses which can span both the intra and extraconal compartments. They have curvilinear flow voids and enhance intensely. Cavernous haemangioma are more common in the adult population and are usually intraconal. They are rounded and well defined with the appearance of a capsule. Their enhancement tends to be slower and more patchy than a capillary haemangioma. Lymphangioma are usually extraconal and are more heterogenous with solid and cystic components and fluid-fluid levels. They can cause sudden proptosis due to haemorrhage. Due to their proteinaceous cystic components they are commonly high on T1 and T2 with minimal enhancement. Retinoblastomas are related to the globe and are heterogenous solid masses containing necrosis and calcification. On imaging, a venous varix appears as a dilated intraconal vessel and can be congenital or acquired, following trauma for example.

Typical CT findings are of pontine hypodensity crossing the midline. On MRI this is T2 and FLAIR hyperintense with T1 hypointensity and restricted diffusion. It can also affect the basal ganglia and subcortical white matter. A pontine infarct could have similar signal characteristics but would typically be a unilateral abnormality that does not cross the midline. Wernicke encephalopathy is associated with chronic alcohol abuse but does not typically affect the pons, instead favouring the thalami, periaqueductal grey matter and mamillary bodies with T2 hyperintensity, contrast enhancement and restricted diffusion.

    "explanation": "Fat embolism can be encountered following trauma or other significant insults such as pancreatitis, burns, liposuction and severe sepsis. In the setting of trauma, long bone fractures are often the underlying cause due to fat from bone marrow entering the circulation. Initial imaging is normal, followed by delayed development at around 24–48 hours of consolidation, and ground glass opacity within the lungs, with fat density pulmonary artery filling defects also possible. In contrast to this, lung contusions and pulmonary lacerations would usually be present at the time of the initial trauma imaging. Lung contusions are often seen in the form of consolidation which is frequently peripherally sited at an interface between the lung and a firmer structure, for example the ribs or mediastinum. Pulmonary lacerations cause a defect in the lung which can fill with blood or air, in which case it is called a pneumatocele. Aspiration pneumonia is possible following trauma but the patient was intubated on admission to hospital so if it was not visible on the trauma CT it is unlikely to have developed since then in the presence of an inflated endotracheal tube.

Extra-axial masses can cause adjacent skull changes such as hyperostosis with meningiomas; however, this is unlikely with an intra-axial lesion. Buckling of the grey−white matter interface is caused by the pressure exerted by an extra-axial mass on the adjacent brain.

They may demonstrate flow voids, particularly at the periphery of the lesion.\nPilocytic astrocytomas can have a similar appearance with a cystic mass and enhancing mural nodule; however, they usually occur in a much younger age group.\nA cavernoma is not a cystic mass and on MRI can have variable appearances depending on the presence of haemorrhage and haemosiderin. This causes blooming on susceptibility weighted imaging.\nEpendymomas often contain cystic components; however they also contain significant solid elements, calcification and haemorrhage.",

    "explanation": "Approximately 30–50% of popliteal artery aneurysms are associated with an abdominal aortic aneurysm; therefore the abdominal aorta needs to be included on the study. In lower limb studies, the contralateral lower limb will automatically be included on the study and assessment of the contralateral popliteal artery is also vital, as they can be bilateral. Other important factors to consider when planning interventional radiological management is the tortuosity of the common and external iliac arteries and mural calcification, particularly at the femoral vessels where vascular access will be required for endovascular repair. The CT should extend to the toes to assess the vessel quality peripheral to the aneurysm, as popliteal aneurysms are associated with peripheral thromboembolic complications.",

Clavicle involvement further narrows the differential; it is described in scleroderma and hyperparathyroidism as well as rheumatoid arthritis and other less common congenital conditions such as cleidocranial dysostosis and pyknodysostosis.\nTherefore, the acro-osteolysis and clavicle erosions combined with the other findings make scleroderma the most likely answer.\nHyperparathyroidism, particularly secondary hyperparathyroidism, can also cause generalised osteopenia, soft tissue calcification, acro-osteolysis and distal clavicle resorption. However, the described deformity and the dilated oesophagus on chest radiograph make scleroderma more likely.\nScleroderma causes an erosive arthropathy affecting the interphalangeal joints and there is commonly deformity with ulnar deviation of the fingers or radial subluxation at the first carpometacarpal joint. Osteopenia can be either periarticular or generalized, and soft tissue wasting and calcification is also common. Another typical finding on chest radiograph is oesophageal dilatation.",

    "explanation": "Tuberculosis (TB) affecting the bowel can present with pain, weight loss, bowel symptoms and fever. It most commonly involves the ileocaecal region, and often preferentially affects the caecum. The ileocaecal valve can become thickened, patulous and over time, rigid. Like Crohn’s disease, there can be both deep fissures and ulceration. The ulceration in TB is usually circumferential, whereas in Crohn’s they are typically longitudinal and typically on the mesenteric border. With chronicity, both conditions can lead to strictures, and in TB the caecum can appear retracted.\nCrohn’s disease tends to be associated with very little ascites whereas there is often more fluid in cases of TB, which can be relatively high density. Both conditions may cause abdominal lymph node enlargement; however in TB these lymph nodes typically demonstrate low attenuation. TB can also cause peritonitis with nodularity and peritoneal thickening.",

    "explanation": "Renal cell carcinoma extending into the renal vein corresponds to at least T3 disease, with proximal extension an important factor in surgical planning. If it extends into the inferior vena cava, then a midline laparotomy is required, and if beyond the level of the hepatic veins, then thoracic surgeons will likely need to be involved.\nIt can be difficult to assess tumour thrombus versus bland thrombus. Sometimes contrast enhancement is identified on post-contrast CT within the thrombus, consistent with tumour; however, MRI is superior to CT for assessment. Tumour thrombus on MRI would also enhance and on T1 weighted imaging the normal vascular flow voids would be replaced by comparatively high tumour signal.\n18F-FDG PET/CT currently has a limited role in the staging of renal cell carcinoma due to renal excretion causing high renal tracer uptake and therefore making assessment difficult. However, there are reports of tracer uptake in tumour thrombi.\nUltrasound Doppler may identify thrombus; however the assessment of bland thrombus versus tumour thrombus would be challenging on ultrasound.\nDigital subtraction angiography does not have a role in this case.",

The history is key; the patient is febrile and the recent pneumonia suggests this could be caused by haematogenous spread from the recent infection. The most commonly affected joints are hip, knee, elbow or ankle, and the most common pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus. The best way to obtain a diagnosis and target antibiotics appropriately is with joint aspiration followed by microscopy and culture of the synovial fluid. Radiology can offer assistance with ultrasound-guided aspiration if needed, but if clinical suspicion is high, joint washout may be pursued regardless.

Other signs of varicocele include a ‘bag of worms’ appearance on physical examination or imaging, particularly in the supine position. The ‘empty scrotum’ seen in the differential diagnoses in this case could be due to testicular atrophy, which might be secondary to a varicocele.

    "explanation": "Liver MRI is frequently employed to help clarify either CT or ultrasound appearances, especially for challenging cases such as in hepatitis B surveillance or in patients with a high body mass index, which can make ultrasound challenging. Normal liver parenchymal signal is hyperintense compared to the spleen on T1 and hypointense compared to the spleen on T2, and there should be no reduction of signal on out-of-phase imaging. Liver signal is also frequently compared to muscle – it should be a similar signal except on inversion recovery sequences. Diffuse signal reduction on out-of-phase imaging can be suggestive of a fatty liver, and similarly the T1 signal may be increased in these patients.",

    "explanation": "Umbilical venous catheters pass superiorly from the umbilical vein into the portal vein and then through the ductus venosus into the hepatic vein and inferior vena cava. The tip should ideally lie at the junction of the inferior vena cava and right atrium, which is around the level of the diaphragm at T8/9. It is important that the catheter is sited correctly because if the tip is within the portal venous system it can lead to thrombosis. The catheter may also pass into the superior mesenteric artery or splenic vein (and be projected over the left upper quadrant (as described in answer E). If the catheter is inserted too far, the tip may be within the right ventricle or the superior vena cava. The path of umbilical arterial catheters should be inferior from the umbilicus going into the pelvis before turning cephalad and passing into the aorta. The aim is for the tip to be within the aorta in either a high or low position but not between the levels of T10-L3, which is where the main aortic branches arise.",

    "explanation": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be split into pulmonary causes (e.g. toxic inhalation, drowning, lung contusion, pneumonia and fat embolus) and extrapulmonary causes (e.g. burns, sepsis, blood transfusion and pancreatitis). This case describes an extrapulmonary cause. The features of symmetrical consolidation with a gradient from posterior to anterior with more ground glass changes anteriorly is typical. Pulmonary causes tend to lead to asymmetrical changes without a gradient. A hospital-acquired pneumonia is possible, although the patient has only had a brief admission so far. An aspiration pneumonia is also possible, especially if there has been vomiting with recent alcohol excess, but in an intensive care patient with pancreatitis and such typical features of ARDS, this is less likely. In cardiac failure, other features such as cardiomegaly, prominent vascular markings, interstitial lines and pleural effusions would be more common. This patient does have a small left pleural effusion but this is likely secondary to the pancreatitis. One of the causes of fat embolism is pancreatitis, and features can resemble ARDS. Typical appearances of fat embolism include geographic ground glass opacities rather than the gradient seen in ARDS. Interlobular septal thickening and nodularity are also features, which are less common in ARDS.",

    "explanation": "This tends to be unilateral, affecting males more than females, although it is described in late pregnancy. The history of hip pain is long, and the classic radiological description is of osteopenia and subchondral cortical loss. An MRI will demonstrate bone marrow oedema, centred on the subchondral region, and early post-contrast enhancement of the abnormal marrow. The history and presentation is not characteristic for septic arthritis and there is no indication that the patient is unwell, as this has been managed as an outpatient. In avascular necrosis the early post-contrast enhancement would not be typical. Although bone marrow oedema is a feature, other signs such as subchondral linear low signal and the ‘double line’ sign are usually present. A stress fracture in an active young patient is possible but in the proximal femur this tends to occur at the femoral neck rather than at the femoral head. A cortical breach and a linear low T1 signal fracture line would also be expected. Complex regional pain syndrome commonly occurs following trauma. Due to sympathetic dysfunction, other symptoms such as alteration to skin blood flow, hyperalgesia and oedema are often described. This condition typically affects the extremities rather than a large joint such as the hip.

    "explanation": "The appearances are typical for a hepatic adenoma. These lesions can be large and heterogenous due to areas of necrosis and haemorrhage. Despite being benign, they are often removed due to the risk of bleeding. They may contain fat, leading to the hyperechoic appearance on ultrasound, T1 hyperintensity and signal drop on out-of-phase imaging. Adenomas can demonstrate washout, and are the only benign lesions which may do so. The hypointensity following hepatocyte specific contrast helps to differentiate it from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) which would be iso to hyperintense due to their hepatocellular origin. Similarly, the absence of a high T2 signal intensity central scar differentiates it from FNH. A fibrolamellar carcinoma typically has a low signal intensity central scar and many cases demonstrate calcification. Hepatic metastases are often T1 hypointense and there is not usually fat present. Haemangiomas commonly cause incidental hyperechoic hepatic lesions on ultrasound but the other features in this case are not typical. They characteristically exhibit centripetal enhancement.",

They typically occur at the trigone of the lateral ventricle. In children a supratentorial location is most likely; however in adults they are more common in the posterior fossa. The majority of tumours are benign but in up to 20% of cases they can become malignant. MRI signal is often described as T1 and T2 isointense with avid homogenous enhancement. Calcification occurs in around 10% of cases. These are distinct from the more common ependymomas, which are typically hypointense to grey matter on T1-weighted sequences and may have a characteristic ‘salt and pepper’ appearance on imaging due to calcification. Astrocytomas are also more common in children and frequently have a heterogeneous signal on MRI, which can range from solid enhancing lesions to cystic lesions with hemorrhagic areas.

    "explanation": "Alexander disease is a progressive disease affecting the white matter in infants. It characteristically starts in the frontal lobes and progresses posteriorly, affecting the basal ganglia too. This causes white matter T2 hyperintensity and enhancement. In the late stages of the disease there can be cystic cavitation. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy has a more posterior distribution of T2 hyperintensity with changes affecting the periventricular parieto-occipital white matter and splenium of the corpus callosum progressing to affect the visual and auditory pathways, with peripheral enhancement commonly seen. Canavan disease has a symmetrical, diffuse, bilateral involvement of subcortical white matter. However, there is usually sparing of the caudate nucleus, corpus callosum and internal capsule. In contrast to Alexander disease, there is no contrast enhancement. MR spectroscopy will reveal elevated N-acetyl-aspartate, which is a hallmark of the condition. Krabbe disease affects the white matter with a periventricular predilection but in a more central and posterior distribution with involvement of the centrum semiovale, thalami and basal ganglia. There is no contrast enhancement in these regions and unlike other leukodystrophies there is enlargement of the optic nerves. Leigh syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder. The changes seen on imaging tend to be symmetrical with T2 hyperintensity in the brainstem, medulla, midbrain and putamen.

    "explanation": "Buscopan is used as an antispasmodic agent for studies where bowel motion may cause image degradation. A complication of Buscopan is acute angle closure glaucoma; however, the chronic open angle form of the condition is not a contraindication. Patients may not know they are at risk of acute angle closure glaucoma until they develop symptoms of eye pain, altered/reduced vision and nausea and vomiting, and so it is important that patients are warned about this. If a patient develops acute angle closure glaucoma, both eyes are usually treated by laser iridotomy at the first presentation to prevent recurrence. Unstable cardiac disease such as poorly controlled left ventricular failure, unstable angina, recent admission with acute coronary syndrome and recent arrhythmia are all contraindications for Buscopan. Hypothyroidism is not a contraindication. There should be caution exercised with hyperthyroidism due to its potential association with tachycardia. Buscopan can hypothetically lead to urinary retention; however, due to its short-acting effects and the relatively low dose used in radiology this is considered to be low risk. A history of prostate cancer should not be a contraindication for Buscopan usage. A conventional pacemaker device is a contraindication for MRI but not for Buscopan administration. Some newer pacemakers are marketed as MRI compatible within certain parameters. A pacemaker will have most likely been inserted due to dysrhythmia and therefore should be able to counteract any Buscopan-induced tachycardia; however, it may be prudent to discuss with cardiology first.",

    "explanation": "A phyllodes tumour is difficult to differentiate from other lesions, such as fibroadenoma, without a biopsy. Typical features include a predominantly solid lesion with posterior acoustic enhancement which may contain cystic spaces and vascularity. Rapid growth is also a characteristic. Breast carcinoma is commonly described as an ill-defined, hypoechoic and spiculate mass with posterior acoustic shadowing. The mass is typically vertically orientated, disrupting tissue planes. High-grade cancers can appear as more focal well-defined masses and hence why biopsy of solid breast lesions is so important. Lobular cancers may be difficult to identify on ultrasound. Fat necrosis follows trauma to the breast, and eliciting this history is important. Its appearance depends on the age of the lesion. It may initially be a focal hyperechoic area in the fat, then become more cystic manifesting as an oil cyst, and finally it can appear as a spiculate area due to desmoplastic reaction. Eggshell calcification is typically associated with it on mammograms. Fibrocystic change is common in young women and can be painful. Simple cysts on ultrasound are anechoic and well defined. A cyst with solid components requires biopsy of the solid component. Prominent fibrous glandular tissue may be palpated and visualised at ultrasound. Papillomas are a cause of nipple discharge and may appear as a solid lesion within a dilated duct or as a solid and cystic mass.",

The features are similar except that in Hurst disease there is increased oedema, mass effect and microhaemorrhages. It is usually fatal, whereas ADEM frequently responds to steroids. ADEM is a white matter abnormality favouring the subcortical white matter, but the brainstem and cerebellum can also be affected. The lesions are FLAIR hyperintense and can have peripheral restricted diffusion and enhancement. The history of recent illness or vaccination is key to the diagnosis. Herpes simplex encephalitis classically involves bilateral temporal lobes and cingulate gyrus. There is commonly both cortical and white matter and cortex T2 hyperintensity rather than the subcortical distribution in this case. There may also be microhaemorrhages. Cerebral abscesses are a differential for peripherally enhancing lesions; however they would usually have central restricted diffusion rather than just peripherally. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is not typical with this history because it is associated with an immunocompromised state.

COP can present similarly but tends to affect all lung zones rather than the upper and middle lobe predominance described in chronic eosinophilic pneumonia.

Pulmonary infarcts can also cause subpleural air space opacification and are secondary to obstructing pulmonary emboli, often leading to wedge shaped areas of abnormality.

Neonates can present with respiratory distress due to narrowing of the trachea and narrowing of the right main bronchus or bronchus intermedius, which can lead to air trapping. The left pulmonary artery arises from the right pulmonary artery and passes between the trachea anteriorly and the oesophagus posteriorly, hence indenting the posterior wall of the trachea and the anterior wall of the oesophagus. It is the only vascular anomaly to pass between the trachea and oesophagus. A double aortic arch causes anterior tracheal and posterior oesophageal indentation. Anterior tracheal compression is caused by innominate artery indentation, which tends to occur in infants who have an arterial origin more towards the left than in adults. The mediastinum is more crowded in infants due to the thymus, and the vessel can therefore indent the trachea just inferior to level of the thoracic inlet. Posterior oesophageal indentation can either be caused with a normal left aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery or with a right aortic arch if there is an aberrant left subclavian artery.",
