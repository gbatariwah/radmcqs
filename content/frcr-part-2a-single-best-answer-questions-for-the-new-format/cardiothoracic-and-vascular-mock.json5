He still has dyspnoea and on examination is noted to have erythema nodosum on his shins. CXR shows diffuse bilateral tiny calcific nodules, some with central calcification, and hilar and mediastinal 'popcorn' calcified lymphadenopathy. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "answer": "Histoplasmosis",
      "explanation": "Histoplasmosis is endemic in certain areas of the USA, particularly Ohio, Mississippi, and the St Lawrence river valley. Acute infection produces flu-like symptoms (polyarthralgia, fever). Acute CXR findings may be non-specific, but include diffuse subsegmental opacities, +/- lymphadenopathy. Sub-acute infection results in small calcific nodules and there may be hilar or mediastinal LNs which can display popcorn calcification. The ‘target lesion’ with central calcification is said to be pathognomonic",

      "explanation": "The main advantages of CO2-angiography is its use in patients where iodinated agents are contraindicated, e.g., renal failure or previous contrast reaction, or for long procedures in order to limit contrast burden (e.g., EVAR placement). CO2 is not diluted by blood thus can opacify central veins more readily from a peripheral approach, which is advantageous when placing IVC filters. The overall quality of CO2 images is reduced as there is decreased density compared to Iodine, thus DSA is essential. Additionally, multiple injections are usually required, thus radiation exposure may be increased",

Segmental artery has been used by some authors, however, this ratio may exceed 1 in normal individuals and, rarely, a ratio of 21.25 can be within normal limits.

      "explanation": "Imaging should not be performed until at least 30 minutes, and more typically 60 minutes after tracer administration to allow clearance from the background blood pool. Patient preparation is key in order to minimise artefacts from physiological uptake. Muscle uptake is reduced by keeping serum insulin levels low, thus patients are fasted for 6 hours prior to the study. It is important to check blood glucose prior to the study as elevated blood glucose competes with FDG for transport, increasing background activity; above a certain level (often quoted as 13 mmol/ml) the procedure may have to be postponed. For imaging in the head/neck region it is advisable to avoid talking for 30-60 minutes prior in order to minimise muscle uptake in this region, similarly strenuous exercise should be avoided 24-48 hours prior to reduce whole-body muscle uptake. Additional avoidance of caffeine is recommended in cardiac/chest imaging as it will increase heart rate, increasing heart size and myocardial uptake",

      "stem": "A follow-up CT is performed in a patient 12 months after an endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) stenting for an enlarged AAA. There is enlargement of the aneurysm sac, with retrograde blood flow entering the sac via lumbar arteries, but with a complete seal around the graft attachment zones. What sub-type of endoleak does this represent?",
      "options": [
        "Type I",
        "Type II",
        "Type III",
        "Type IV",
        "Type V"
      ],
      "answer": "Type II",
      "explanation": "It is also termed retrograde or non-graft related endoleak. Type I is due to inadequate or ineffective seal at the graft ends. Type III is due to a defect in the graft fabric (mechanical graft failure). Type IV is a minor blush of contrast due to contrast diffusion across the pores of the graft fabric; it is usually an inherent part of the graft design",

      ],
      "answer": "Pericardial veins",
      "explanation": "The extent and location of collateral opacification in SVCO at CT depends on the location/ degree of obstruction and the site/ timing of contrast injection. Major collateral pathways include the azygous, hemiazygous, internal thoracic, lateral thoracic veins, and the thoraco-acromioclavicular venous complex. Minor collateral pathways include the anterior jugular, the pericardial and umbilical veins; the parascapular, pericardial superficial, thoraco-abdominal and epigastric veins may also be opacified",
