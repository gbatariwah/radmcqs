      "answer": "Castleman’s disease",
      "explanation": "Castleman's disease is a low-grade B-cell lymphoid proliferation of unknown aetiology. It can be localised or multicentric (multiple LNs, typically with systemic symptoms, with a poorer prognosis). The nodes may be as large as 16 cm, classically enhance avidly, and may have central calcification. Resection is curative in 90% of patients with the localised form. Metastases from vascular tumours may also produce similar findings (e.g. melanoma, RCC, papillary thyroid cancer). NHL can have similar features, but untreated lymphoma is not expected to produce calcified lymph nodes. The acute disseminated form of LCH can be associated with lymphadenopathy, but this is usually generalised, the patient would be expected to be systemically unwell, and these nodes do not typically calcify",

Partial defects are more common on the left (complete left-sided absence 35%, foramina! defect left side 35%). In complete left-sided absence, the heart is shifted to the left and rotated, the PA view of the heart mimics an RAO view and the heart is separated from the sternum on the lateral view. In foraminal left-sided defects, there may only be prominence of the left atrial appendage (appears as left hilar mass, may mimic left PA enlargement).

Causes of pulmonary haemorrhage/vasculitis can also give this appearance (e.g. Wegener’s granulomatosis or Goodpasture’s syndrome).

      "answer": "Heart size 15 cm",
      "explanation": "ARDS is a response of the lung to injury which may be direct or indirect; radiological features are those of non-cardiogenic oedema which develops as a consequence but unlike simple oedema an interstitial fibrosis may develop. Mechanical ventilation is thought to contribute to this process. Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure 18 mmHg suggests raised left atrial pressures. The diagnosis of ARDS requires the ratio of arterial oxygenation to inspired oxygen to be < 200 mmHg",

      "stem": "A 53 year old man presents with abdominal pain. A post-contrast abdominal CT examination is performed in the portal phase which reveals an enlarged aorta with an eccentric thrombosed channel, extending over 8 cm. Which of the following features makes a thrombosed aneurysm more likely than a chronic dissection?",
      "options": [
        "Involvement of the SMA",
        "Small aortic lumen",
        "Mural calcification displaced outwards",
        "Thrombus extending over 6 cm cranio-caudally",
        "Total aortic diameter > 5 cm"
      ],
      "answer": "Mural calcification displaced outwards",
      "explanation": "A thrombosed aneurysm and thrombosed blood within the false lumen of a chronic dissection can have similar appearances. In thrombosed aneurysm the calcium is typically displaced outwards, thus appears to be pushed outside from the aortic lumen (in dissection any calcium, if present would be displaced medially, ‘inside’ the lumen), in addition there is likely to be extensive calcification seen elsewhere in the wall. Dissection usually extends over a longer (> 6 cm) cranio-caudal distance and, although the overall aortic size is normal in the acute phase, it can be very large (> 5 cm) in the chronic phase. The aortic lumen is likely to be normal or small in dissection, but is expected to be large with an aneurysm. Involved vessels are not a reliable guide, but an aneurysm tends to involve the lumbar branches, a dissection of the renal arteries and the SMA",

      "stem": "A 56 year old man undergoes single lung transplantation for sarcoid-related lung disease. At day 10 post-operatively he becomes increasingly dyspnoeic. The CXR shows increased consolidation within the graft lung. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Acute rejection",
        "Aspergillus infection",
        "Cytomegalovirus infection",
        "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder",
        "Recurrent sarcoidosis"
      ],
      "answer": "Acute rejection",
      "explanation": "Acute rejection typically presents within the first 4 weeks, CXR may be normal, or show oedema, worsening consolidation, peribronchial thickening, new pleural effusions, or septal lines without evidence of LVF. Infection in the first 4 weeks of transplantation is almost invariably bacterial. Acute rejection is the only other condition common within the first month and is extremely common after 1 week. CMV, PTLD and Aspergillus infection typically occur more than 4 weeks post-transplantation; recurrent disease would also be expected later, but is more common in sarcoid (35%) than other conditions (< 1%)",
