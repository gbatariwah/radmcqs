They are stromal tumours, which form in the interstitial tissues that support the testes. The Leydig cells produce hormones, thus such tumours are typically hormonally active and lead to feminising or virilising syndromes; 30% secrete estradiol, resulting in gynaecomastia. B-HCG, a-FP and LDH levels are typically normal (B-HCG is 'always' raised in choriocarcinoma and in 83% of seminomas; a-FP is raised in >90% of yolk sac tumours)",
