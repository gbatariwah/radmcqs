      ],
      "answer": "Ground glass changes",
      "explanation": "In HMD the lungs are hypoinflated due to surfactant deficiency and hypoaeration (unless the patient is intubated). In meconium aspiration the lungs may be of normal volume, but are typically hyperinflated due to air trapping. The other findings are non-specific and may be present in both conditions",

      "explanation": "ET tubes should be positioned 1-1.5 cm above the carina. UACs should be sited above the renal arteries between T6-10, or alternatively between L3-5; a position within the aortic arch is too high. PICC lines should lie in a central vein, beyond the subclavian vein ideally at the SVC/ RA junction, but a position in the branchiocephalic vein is also acceptable",

Most are radiolucent, paired inspiratory/ expiratory CXRs are the most sensitive, however, the child may not cooperate.

      "explanation": "Beginning fluoroscopy with the cones closed then opening to the desired field size will help reduce dose. Grid removal will lower dose, however, in larger children, a grid may be needed to produce images of adequate quality. Patient dose is lower with an over-couch table (staff dose will be higher)",

Air reduction is now used in most centres and answers (a), (c), (d) and (e) list its advantages. The only disadvantage of air reduction is confirmation of reduction across the ileo-caecal valve, especially when gas is present in the ileum.

Although (rarely) this sequence varies, ‘I’ always comes before ‘T’, thus if the trochlea is present, the medial condyle has to be present - its absence implies an avulsion #. The medial epicondyle is extracapsular there is typically no fat pad elevation, however, there will be if the capsule is torn, in such cases there is a risk the medial epicondyle will be displaced into the elbow joint, thus cannot be seen on the initial radiographs (as implied in the scenario given)",

      "answer": "Rickets",
      "explanation": "Rickets is osteomalacia resulting from vitamin D deficiency that occurs during enchondral bone growth and can be primary or secondary (Gl, renal, hepatic causes). There is failure of osteoid mineralisation; increased osteoid production elevates the periosteum and widens the epiphyseal plates. There is ‘softening’ of the diaphysis, resulting in bowing deformity of the long bones. The metaphyses are classically flayed (irregular), splayed (widened) and cupped. Blount disease presents > 6 years and may have bowing of the legs secondary to AVN of the medial tibial condyle",

      "answer": "Capsular distension of 2 mm diagnoses an effusion",
      "explanation": "TS presents at 5-10 years and is the commonest cause of a non-traumatic limp in this age group. US is performed with the child supine and the hip in the neutral position, or in slight external rotation. US typically shows an effusion (capsular distension 2 2 mm), without synovial thickening. It is a diagnosis of exclusion, radiographs may help differentiate Perthe’s disease; fluid aspiration helps exclude septic arthritis",

      ],
      "answer": "US shows blood flow in the intussusceptum",
      "explanation": "Vascular flow is a good sign - ischaemia is unlikely. A left-sided lesion is more difficult to treat, but the majority are ileocolic (75-95%) or ileo-ileocolic (9%); colocolic lesions are very rare. A short history (< 24 hours) suggests there will be less oedema and the intussusception is less likely to have passed through to the left colon. An older age (> 12 months) suggests a pathological lead point may be the aetiology. Intussusception is idiopathic in 95% of paediatric cases",

      "explanation": "A bone-in-bone appearance is often best seen in the vertebrae. It may be a normal appearance (particularly in the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae in infants). Secondary causes include Caffey’s, SCD, thalassaemia, congenital syphilis, osteopetrosis, oxalosis, radiation, acromegaly, paget’s disease (older population), rickets, TB, scurvy, hypoparathyroidism, hypothyroidism, lead poisoning and gaucher’s disease",

      "explanation": "All are causes of a generalised increase in bone density. Pyknodysostosis is also associated with dwarfism, mental retardation, widened hands and feet, brachycephaly, platybasia, widened sutures, and hypoplastic tapered terminal phalangeal tufts. It is possibly a variant of cleidocranial dysostosis, but this latter condition lacks the features of dense bones, phalangeal hypoplasia and short stature",

      "explanation": "Although less-specific for NAI, diaphyseal fractures are 4x more frequent than the more NAI-characteristic metaphyseal fractures. A key diagnostic feature of NAI is the presence of multiple fractures of differing ages. Other fractures that occur frequently but have less specificity are mid-clavicular fractures and simple linear skull fractures. Fractures of the scapula, spinous processes and sternum (the ‘3 Ss’) and depressed fractures of the occiput are also considered specific for NAI, but rare",
