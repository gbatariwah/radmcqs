      "explanation": "The majority of inhaled foreign bodies are food material (e.g. peanuts), thus are not radio-opaque. The paediatric airway diameter increases in inspiration, decreases in expiration — a partial obstruction in inspiration may become complete in expiration, allowing air-trapping in expiration. The carinal angle is symmetric in infants making it equally likely that a foreign body will pass into either left or right mainstem bronchus. Radiographic evidence of air trapping is typical, however, no imaging modality can definitely exclude the diagnosis; therefore, if the history is suggestive, the child should undergo bronchoscopy",

      "answer": "Reducing the gantry rotation speed",
      "explanation": "Increasing gantry rotation speed will reduce dose and also decreases movement artefact. Use of AEC reduces dose by automatically adjusting current in response to the attenuation of the section scanned. Reducing mA reduces dose, but noise is increased. There is an exponential relationship between kVp and dose, thus decreasing kVp greatly reduces dose; however, there are greater beam hardening artefacts and noise increases",

      "explanation": "Anorectal malformation may be low (commonest), intermediate, or high, depending on the relation to the levator sling. High malformations are associated with fistulas and a high association with GU (50%), and VACTERL anomalies. History of surgical repair makes fistulas unlikely; post-op patients often suffer urinary incontinence; the additional association of spinal anomalies makes neurogenic bladder (which predisposes to UTI) a likelihood.

      "answer": "Sickle cell disease",
      "explanation": "Bilateral AVN of the femoral head is described; plain film signs may lag several months behind symptom onset. Perthe’s can cause idiopathic AVN and is bilateral in 5-10% (systemic disorders are more likely to be bilateral), but typically presents at 5-10 years, and the patient was described as having a normal X-ray aged 14. Other causes to consider are trauma, collagen vascular diseases, glycogen storage diseases, drug therapy (steroids)",

      "explanation": "TAPVC describes return of the pulmonary veins to the RA rather than the LA; there are 3 types: supracardiac, cardiac and infracardiac. Supracardiac is the commonest; the veins drain into a common left-sided trunk which runs superiorly and drains into the left innominate vein then the SVC, widening the superior mediastinum to give the ‘snowman’ (‘cottage loaf’ or ‘figure 8’) appearance. Scimitar syndrome is a type of PAPVC",

      "answer": "Aortic aneurysm",
      "explanation": "The conditions have a similar phenotype. In Marfan’s there is MV prolapse, aortic regurgitation, coarctation, and dissecting aneurysm of the ascending aorta; lens dislocation is upwards and outwards (down/inward in homocystinuria). Homocystinuria is an enzyme deficiency disorder, leading to homocystine build-up which causes a defect in collagen structure. Features which help distinguish it from Marfan’s include the propensity for thrombo-emboli disease and osteoporosis (osteopaenia in Marfan’s)",

They are not due to increased intracranial pressure/ hydrocephalus, but are associated with Chiari II malformations, encephalocoeles, and myelomeningocoeles.
