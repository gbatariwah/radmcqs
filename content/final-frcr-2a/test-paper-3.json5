      explanation: "Pseudoaneurysms are common vascular abnormalities that represent a disruption in arterial wall continuity. Surgical repair was the treatment of choice for superficial extremity pseudoaneurysms until US-guided compression was introduced. US-guided percutaneous thrombin injection has replaced US-guided compression as the therapeutic method of choice for treatment of post-catheterisation pseudoaneurysms. Endovascular techniques like stent placement (indispensable artery) or embolisation (dispensable artery) have a lower complication rate in the treatment of visceral pseudoaneurysms than does surgical management",

      explanation: "At pathologic analysis, active inflammation is characterised by varying degrees of neutrophilic crypt injury. In mildly active Crohn’s disease, a small fraction of crypts are infiltrated by neutrophils (cryptitis), with associated crypt destruction and mucin depletion. As the degree of activity increases, there is a corresponding increase in the proportion of involved crypts and the severity of crypt injury, including crypt epithelial necrosis, intraluminal exudates (crypt abscess), and eventual ulcer formation. Two types of ulcers are seen in Crohn’s disease: superficial aphthous ulcers and deep fissuring ulcers. Deep fissuring ulcers are more problematic than superficial aphthous ulcers; they break through the mucosa and into the deeper layers of the bowel wall, initially resulting in submucosal inflammation and oedema. Some investigators have reported that deep ulcers may be seen in MR enterography, whereas superficial ulcers defy detection",

Classic medulloblastoma typically arises from the roof of the fourth ventricle and is midline in location in 75%–90% of cases. Classic medulloblastoma is a highly cellular, densely packed tumour, which is reflected on imaging; it appears hyperdense relative to brain on CT (89% of cases) and shows restricted diffusion on DWI.

Many adenomas are first diagnosed in symptomatic patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability, or other signs of rupture, most of whom are on OCP. The gold standard has been to perform emergency laparotomy with gauze packing or partial liver resection. Laparoscopic resection is also possible in theory, but it is technically difficult. Recently, less invasive procedures such as transarterial embolisation have been developed that may also lead to adequate haemostasis without the need for urgent laparotomy, and they are considered the first treatment option. RFA is used in non-ruptured adenomas and its use after haemorrhage may be irrelevant",

      answer: "Mesenteric fibro-fatty proliferation",
      explanation: "The main diagnostic purpose of CT enterography in the setting of Crohn’s disease is to differentiate active inflammatory strictures from fibrotic strictures in order to guide therapy. CT features of active Crohn’s disease include mucosal hyperenhancement, wall thickening (thickness >3 mm), mural stratification with a prominent vasa recta (comb sign) and mesenteric fat stranding, all of which are exquisitely demonstrated at CT enterography. The capability of CT enterography to depict extra-enteric disease allows the simultaneous diagnosis of complications associated with Crohn’s disease, such as obstruction, sinus tract, fistula and abscess formation. Mural enhancement is the most sensitive indicator of active Crohn’s disease. Care should be taken to compare bowel loops with similar distention, since both the jejunum and normal collapsed loops may demonstrate regions of higher attenuation, simulating enhancement. Inadequately distended bowel loops may be difficult to assess, and secondary signs of active disease, such as mesenteric fat stranding, vasa recta prominence or complications such as fistulas and abscesses should be sought to maximise the accuracy of a diagnosis of active disease. Prominence of the vasa recta adjacent to the inflamed loop of bowel (comb sign), along with increased mesenteric fat attenuation, is the most specific CT feature of active Crohn’s disease. Findings that might be seen in inactive long-standing Crohn’s disease include submucosal fat deposition, pseudosacculation, surrounding fibro-fatty proliferation and fibrotic strictures",

Two types of craniopharyngiomas have been described: a childhood type, with frequent occurrence of cyst formation and calcifications and generally a poor prognosis, and an adult type, generally without calcifications or cyst formation and generally a good prognosis. The cystic areas may be iso-, hyper- or hypointense relative to brain tissue with T1-weighted sequences. The short T1 relaxation times are the result of very high protein content. With T2-weighted sequences, both the cystic and solid components tend to have high signal intensity. After the administration of contrast material, the solid portions enhance heterogeneously. The thin walls of the cystic areas nearly always enhance. The characteristic calcifications in paediatric craniopharyngiomas may not be discernible, although gradient-echo images may show susceptibility effects from calcified components. Occasionally, craniopharyngiomas are predominantly solid, typically without calcification",

Kidneys with multiple arterial supply are more likely to have vascular complications.

      response: "",
      answer: "Haemophilic arthropathy",
      explanation: "Radiographic findings vary greatly with the different stages of haemophilic arthropathy (acute, subacute or chronic haemarthrosis) and reflect the presence of haemarthrosis (joint effusion), synovial inflammation and hyperaemia (osteoporosis and epiphyseal overgrowth), chondral erosions and subchondral resorption (osseous erosions and cysts), cartilaginous denudation (joint space narrowing), intraosseous or subperiosteal haemorrhage (pseudotumours) and osseous proliferation (sclerosis and osteophytosis). Some abnormalities of osseous shape, such as widening of the intercondylar notch, flattening of the condylar surface or squaring of the patella, are very characteristic of chronic haemarthrosis of the knee. At MR imaging, hypertrophied synovial membrane resulting from repetitive haemarthrosis has characteristic low signal intensity with all pulse sequences, especially with gradient-echo sequences, due to the magnetic susceptibility effect caused by haemosiderin. As in pigmented villonodular synovitis, the signal intensity of the subarticular defects varies and may indicate the presence of fluid (high signal intensity on T2-weighted images), soft tissue (intermediate signal intensity) or synovial tissue with haemosiderin (low signal intensity). Rapidly destructive articular disease is an unusual form of osteoarthritis that typically involves the hip. The disease is almost always unilateral, but bilateral lesions and involvement of shoulder have also been reported. Serial radiographs show progressive loss of joint space and loss of subchondral bone in the femoral head and acetabulum, resulting in marked flattening and deformity of the femoral head ('hatchet' deformity). Superolateral subluxation of the femoral head or intrusion deformity within the ilium can be observed. Most cases demonstrate subchondral defects and mild sclerosis. However, osteophytes are small or absent",

      explanation: "Urine leaks and urinomas are relatively rare complications and are usually found in the first 2 weeks post-operative between the transplanted kidney and the bladder. They appear as a well-defined, anechoic fluid collection with no septations that increases in size rapidly. Antegrade pyelography is necessary to provide detailed information about the site of origin of the urinoma and in planning appropriate intervention. Haematomas are common in the immediate post-operative period, but they may also develop spontaneously or as a consequence of trauma or biopsy. At US, haematomas demonstrate a complex appearance. Acute haematomas are echogenic and become less echogenic with time. Older haematomas even appear anechoic, more closely resembling fluid, and septations may develop. Lymphoceles are the most common peritransplant fluid collections that may develop at any time, from weeks to years after transplantation. However, they usually occur within 1–2 months after transplantation. At US, lymphoceles are anechoic and may have septations. Similar to other peritransplant fluid collections, they can become infected and can develop a more complex appearance. Abscesses have a complex, cystic, non-specific appearance at US. Peritransplant abscesses are an uncommon complication and usually develop within the first few weeks after transplantation",

DNET is a benign, supratentorial and predominantly cortical intra-axial lesion, characterised by a multinodular architecture. Although DNETs are usually located in the temporal lobe, any lobe within the brain lobes may be involved. They have a cortical base and an apex pointing towards the lateral ventricle. They are homogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images and hypointense on T1-weighted images. Some delicate septa-like structures are visible within the lesions. Despite their size, neither mass effect nor surrounding parenchymal oedema is present. On FLAIR images, the lesions show a hyperintense ring. Susceptibility-weighted images do not depict any hypointense signal in the lesion, which indicates the absence of calcium or blood products. Very high ADC values are measured inside the mass. No contrast enhancement is noted and there is scalloping of overlying bone. The differential diagnosis includes other brain tumours, such as ganglioglioma (cyst with a strongly enhancing mural nodule, frequent calcification), angiocentric glioma (hyperintense on T1 and star-like extension to ventricle), low-grade astrocytoma (similar to DNET but no scalloping of bone or rim of FLAIR) and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (cyst with mural nodule, enhancement and dural tail)",

      explanation: "The characteristic triad of the Dandy–Walker malformation includes (1) complete or partial agenesis of the vermis, (2) cystic dilatation of the fourth ventricle and (3) an enlarged posterior fossa with upward displacement of the lateral sinuses, tentorium and torcula. The triad is usually associated with hydrocephalus (most common presentation 80%), but this condition should be considered a common complication and not as part of the malformation itself. Depending on the degree of hydrocephalus, the age at diagnosis varies from the neonatal period to later childhood. The skull is enlarged, with characteristic thinning and bulging of the occiput. Pressure from the massively dilated fourth ventricle, along with cerebrospinal fluid pulsations, causes erosive scalloping of the occiput and petrous temporal bones. The cerebellar hemispheres are typically hypoplastic, and in extreme cases only a small nubbin of compressed cerebellar tissue is identified contiguous laterally with the wall of the posterior fossa cyst. Anomalies of the posterior inferior cerebellar arteries, especially absence of the inferior vermian branches and absence of the inferior vermian vein, help in the angiographic differentiation of a Dandy–Walker cyst from an arachnoid cyst, in which the vessels are displaced but present. The Dandy–Walker variant is used to describe a cystic posterior fossa malformation with varying degrees of agenesis of the vermis associated with expansion (often considerable) of the fourth ventricle, which communicates freely with the perimedullary subarachnoid space",

Current data suggest that although bowel distension achieved with the enteric intubation technique generally is superior to that achieved with enterography, the improved distension does not necessarily translate into a clinically significant improvement in diagnostic effectiveness. A recent study confirmed the benefit of enteric intubation for bowel distension but reported equivalent diagnostic performances with the enteric and oral techniques in identifying stenoses and fistulas. However, MR enteroclysis was superior to MR enterography in demonstrating mucosal abnormalities. The importance of detecting mucosal disease in patients without bowel obstruction has diminished in the era of capsule endoscopy. Patient acceptance, which favours MR enterography over MR enteroclysis, also must be considered, because many patients need multiple examinations",

      answer: "Rathke cleft cyst",
      explanation: "Rathke cleft cysts are benign cystic sellar lesions that are generally asymptomatic, but they may be associated with hypopituitarism, visual disturbance and headache. At MR imaging, Rathke cleft cysts have a variable T1 signal, depending on the protein concentration. Cysts with high protein content demonstrate high T1 signal and usually low intracystic water content that leads to T2 signal decrease. Thus, typical Rathke cleft cysts appear as non-enhancing well-demarcated intrasellar rounded lesions located exactly at the midline between the anterior and posterior pituitary lobes. The cysts have a homogeneously hyperintense T1 signal and, often, a hypointense T2 signal. Axial images are crucial for identifying the specific location and characteristic kidney shape of a Rathke cleft cyst. The presence of fluid–fluid level or haemorrhagic debris in an intrasellar lesion suggests a pituitary adenoma, because a Rathke cleft cyst almost never bleeds. Craniopharyngioma typically appears as intrasellar or suprasellar heterogeneously enhancing lesions with a tripartite structure of solid, calcified and cystic components. They are difficult to distinguish from pituitary adenoma, although the fluid–fluid level is more likely to suggest a pituitary adenoma",

A radial meniscal tear manifests as a linear collection of high signal in the meniscus that extends to the superior or inferior articular surfaces. Rupture of the ACL or PCL results in the ligament losing the normal position and morphology but not a double PCL sign.

Oesophageal and gastric involvement usually manifests as dysmotility, wall thickening and gastroesophageal reflux disease. This results from amyloid infiltration of the muscularis and/or destruction of the Auerbach plexus. When the small intestine is involved, the most common finding is diffuse or nodular wall thickening. Abdominal pain, malabsorption and haemorrhage are rare complications. Colonic biopsy specimens are positive in 80% of patients with systemic amyloidosis. Contrary to the high pathologic specificity, radiologic findings are rare and non-specific. The most common finding is colonic dilatation owing to adynamic ileus and more rarely bowel wall thickening. Even more rarely, intramural bowel haemorrhage or perforation can occur. Splenomegaly is the only finding associated with splenic involvement. This causes increased fragility, and spontaneous rupture can ensue with life-threatening consequences. The liver is also commonly involved, but radiologic signs are also non-specific. Diffuse infiltration is the rule, which causes decreased attenuation at CT and hepatomegaly.

      answer: "Ruptured dermoid cyst",
      explanation: "Dermoid cysts are congenital ectodermal inclusion cysts. They tend to occur in the midline sellar, parasellar, or frontonasal regions or in the posterior fossa, where they occur either as vermian lesions or within the fourth ventricle. Imaging findings vary, depending on whether the cyst has ruptured. Unruptured cysts have the same imaging characteristics as fat because they contain liquid cholesterol. All are hyperintense on T1-weighted images and do not enhance. The masses have heterogeneous signal intensity on T2-weighted images and vary from hypo- to hyperintense. The best diagnostic clue of a ruptured dermoid cyst is fatlike droplets in the subarachnoid cisterns, sulci and ventricles. Extensive pial enhancement can be seen from chemical meningitis caused by ruptured cysts. Dermoid cysts may be confused with an epidermoid cyst, craniopharyngioma, teratoma or lipoma. Epidermoid cysts typically resemble CSF (not fat), lack dermal appendages, and are usually located off-midline. Like dermoid cysts, craniopharyngiomas are suprasellar, with a midline location, and demonstrate nodular calcification. However, most craniopharyngiomas are strikingly hyperintense on T2-weighted images and enhance strongly. Teratomas may also have a similar location but usually occur in the pineal region. Lipomas demonstrate homogeneous fat attenuation and/or signal intensity and show a chemical shift artefact, which typically does not occur with dermoid cysts",

The basal ganglia are typically spared. Extralimbic involvement is more prevalent in children than in adults, seen most commonly in the parietal lobe, with sparing of the basal ganglia. Eventually, it results in marked cystic encephalomalacia and volume loss in affected areas. In immunocompromised patients, involvement can be more diffuse and is more likely to involve the brainstem. Early diagnosis is difficult and a ‘normal’ CT is often seen. Affected areas appear low on T1-weighted MRI due to oedema. High T1 signal suggests areas of haemorrhage. Post-contrast enhancement is usually late and can be gyral, leptomeningeal, ring or diffuse enhancement. Affected white matter and cortex appears high signal on T2-weighted and FLAIR images. Areas of haemorrhage show low T2 signal and blooming artefact. DWI is more sensitive than T2-weighted images. Cytotoxic oedema is seen as high signal on DWI with corresponding low signal on ADC map.

Anatomically, structures in the pericardial space including great vessels constitute the middle mediastinum; structures anterior to the pericardial sac constitute the anterior mediastinum, and structures behind the sac constitute the posterior mediastinum. The Felson method of radiological division is based on lateral chest radiography. A line extending from the diaphragm to the thoracic inlet along the back of the heart and anterior to the trachea separates the anterior and middle mediastinum, whereas a line that connects points 1 cm behind the anterior margins of the vertebral bodies separates the middle and posterior mediastinal compartments. The hilum overlay sign is present when the normal hilar structures project through a mass, meaning that the mass is either anterior or posterior to the hilum. Loss of anterior junction line and cardiac contours would suggest anterior location; preservation of these lines and the loss or widening of the posterior junction lines, paraspinal lines, would suggest posterior location. Lymphoma, teratoma and goitre are anterior mediastinal masses. Nerve sheath tumours are the only true posterior mediastinal structures amongst the examples",

With diagnosis based on clinical manifestations alone, acute epiploic appendagitis is misdiagnosed in the majority of patients. Clinically, acute epiploic appendagitis manifests with acute onset of pain, most often in the left lower quadrant, and this symptom often leads to its being mistaken for acute diverticulitis. Unlike acute epiploic appendagitis, acute diverticulitis is more likely to manifest with evenly distributed lower abdominal pain and to be associated with nausea, fever and leucocytosis. Although most patients with acute epiploic appendagitis do not report any change in their bowel habits, a minority experience constipation or diarrhoea. Most patients with acute epiploic appendagitis have a normal white blood cell count and body temperature. CT images from less than 8% of patients evaluated for exclusion of sigmoid diverticulitis or appendicitis show features of primary acute epiploic appendagitis. When acute epiploic appendagitis involves the cecum or ascending colon, it may be mistaken clinically for acute appendicitis.

      explanation: "Fibrous dysplasia is an uncommon, benign disorder characterised by a tumour-like proliferation of fibro-osseous tissue. It may either present as monostotic (affecting one bone) or polyostotic (affecting many bones). Fibrous dysplasia is usually found in the proximal femur, tibia, humerus, ribs and craniofacial bones in decreasing order of incidence. Polyostotic cases can affect multiple adjacent bones or multiple extremities. Men and women are equally affected by the disorder. Fibrous dysplasia is usually asymptomatic, although pain and swelling may accompany the lesion. Radiographically, fibrous dysplasia appears as a well-circumscribed lesion in a long bone with a ground-glass or hazy appearance of the matrix. There is a narrow zone of transition and no periosteal reaction or soft-tissue mass. The lesions are normally located in the metaphysis or diaphysis. There is sometimes focal thinning of the overlying cortex, called ‘scalloping from within’. The radiological appearance can also be cystic, pagetoid, or dense and sclerotic. Repeated fractures through lesions in the proximal femur can result in the formation of a so-called shepherd’s crook deformity. The Tc-99m bone scan uptake may be normal or increased. Bone scans are not helpful in diagnosing these lesions but can be useful in identifying asymptomatic lesions. MRI or CT scans can be helpful in delineating the extent of the lesion and identifying possible pathological fractures. Sarcomatous change within the lesion can be identified by MRI or CT",

      answer: "Blount disease",
      explanation: "All of the answers can lead to leg bowing in paediatric groups. However, the description is that of Blount disease, otherwise known as tibia vara. This is a common condition that is unilateral or asymmetrical and is thought to arise as a result of abnormal stress (such as obesity and walking at an early age) on the posteromedial proximal tibial physis. There are three types: infantile (the most common), juvenile and adolescent. Anteroposterior radiography of both legs is necessary. Neurofibromatosis may cause anterolateral tibial bowing, possibly with fibular hypoplasia, and one or both bones may fracture to give a pseudarthrosis. Developmental or physiological bowing is where there is exaggeration of varus angulation between the ages of 12 and 24 months, which again may be caused by obesity or early walking. There is metaphyseal beaking but no fragmentation, and it is usually symmetrical and bilateral. Congenital bowing is usually convex posteromedially (unlike neurofibromatosis). Marked dorsiflexion of the foot is evident at birth, as this condition is thought to arise from an abnormal intrauterine position. Radiography shows thickening of the cortex of the concavity of the curvature. Osteogenesis imperfecta causes bowing of multiple long bones as a result of osteoporotic softening and fractures; hence bone density reduction and bilateral bowing would be more likely",

Bilateral indentation is caused by a double aortic arch; the right arch is normally higher and larger than the left. Aberrant right subclavian artery from a normal arch or an aberrant left subclavian artery from a right-sided arch traverses behind the oesophagus as it crosses the mediastinum and results in a posterior impression on the oesophagus seen on a lateral view. An aberrant left pulmonary artery traverses between the trachea and oesophagus above the carina, resulting in a posterior indentation on the trachea and an anterior indentation on the oesophagus on lateral view. Coarctation of the aorta results in a reverse-3 impression on the left of the oesophagus on an AP image.

      answer: "Involved seminal vesicles show a high signal on T2W images",
      explanation: "MR tumour staging criteria follow the TNM system. A papillary tumour is best seen on T1-weighted images, where it is seen as higher signal than the urine. It appears similar in signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. Tumour demonstration (especially a small one) is facilitated by use of contrast. To evaluate infiltration, T2-weighted or post-contrast T1-weighted sequences are required. Use of surface coils (endorectal coils) improves visualisation of layers of the bladder wall, improving staging of T2–T3b tumours. Visualisation of low-intensity bladder wall on T2-weighted sequence between the tumour and perivesical fat helps in differentiating a T2b tumour from a T3 tumour. Disruption of low-signal bladder wall, perivesical fat stranding and irregularity of the outer bladder wall suggests T3b disease. Dynamic contrast-induced MRI improves bladder cancer staging accuracy by helping differentiation of tumour (enhances earlier) from inflammatory post-biopsy changes in the bladder wall or perivesical fat (slower rate of enhancement). It is also useful in staging nodes, because abnormal nodes (normal or abnormal by size) enhance earlier than non-metastatic lymph nodes. Involvement of the seminal vesicle is evident as an increase in size of the vesicle, reduced T2 signal, and obliteration of the angle between the seminal vesicle and posterior bladder wall. In contrast, invasion of the prostate and rectum is seen as direct tumour extension and an increase in signal intensity on T2-weighted images",

      explanation: "Contrast-enhanced CT is the imaging modality of choice for the diagnosis and staging of acute pancreatitis. The pancreas enhances uniformly in mild acute pancreatitis and may be normal or enlarged with a variable amount of increased attenuation in the adjacent fat, termed ‘stranding’. Local oedema is a common finding and may extend along the mesentery, mesocolon and hepatoduodenal ligament and into the peritoneal spaces. Extension of oedematous fluid into the anterior perirenal space may create a mass effect and a halo sign with sparing of the perinephric fat. Abnormal ultrasound findings are seen in 33%–90% of patients with acute pancreatitis. Interstitial oedema in acute pancreatitis is depicted on ultrasound as an enlarged hypoechoic gland. Although ultrasound may be used to identify peripancreatic acute fluid collections, it is not useful for the detection of necrosis. Thus its main role in the imaging of acute pancreatitis is limited to the detection of cholelithiasis and choledocholithiasis and identification of fluid collections in the peritoneum, retroperitoneum and pleural spaces",

The zonal anatomy is best seen on T2-weighted images with the peripheral zone showing a high signal compared to both the central and the transitional zones. The central and transitional zones have similar low signal. At a young age, the transitional zone is homogenous low signal; it gets increasingly heterogeneous with age and BPH changes. On T2-weighted images, the shape of the peripheral zone changes from the base to apex. At the base, the peripheral zone surrounds the posterolateral aspect of the central zone, while at the apex it concentrically surrounds the central zone. The prostatic capsule separates the peripheral zone from the periprostatic tissue, whereas the surgical pseudocapsule separates the peripheral zone from the transitional zone in the older population.

On FLAIR, epidermoid cysts become hyperintense or appear more heterogeneous compared to an arachnoid cyst. There are occasions when an epidermoid may appear as a low-intensity lesion on FLAIR.

Several patterns of ultrasound findings have been described, including an echogenic mass, a ground-glass pattern (diffuse low-level echoes), a whirled pattern of mixed echogenicity and a ‘fishnet weave’ pattern (fine septations or reticular echoes). Appendix abscess would be thick-walled. Ovarian dermoid may present as an echogenic mass, although acoustic shadowing would be more typical owing to internal calcifications and would not resolve in this fashion. Ectopic pregnancy may present as an echogenic ‘tubal mass’, although elevated β-hCG would be a feature. Ovarian torsion may appear as an enlarged echogenic ovary (owing to oedema) and, like haemorrhagic cyst, often lacks internal colour Doppler flow, although it is less common than haemorrhagic cyst.

It occurs at the time of injury, but it may be undetectable on chest radiography for the first 6 hours after trauma; however, CT may show it immediately. The pooling of haemorrhage and oedema will blossom at 24 hours, rendering the contusion more evident. The appearance of consolidation on CXR after the first 24 hours should raise the suspicion of other pathological conditions such as aspiration, pneumonia and fat embolism. Clearance of an uncomplicated contusion begins at 24–48 hours with complete resolution after 3–14 days.

If the patient is hypotensive as a result of venous bleeding, a pelvic wrap should stabilise the pelvis sufficiently to cause significant reduction or cessation in the venous haemorrhage and thus avoid unnecessary endovascular intervention. If this fails to achieve sufficiently prompt haemodynamic stability, there is a significant chance that there is arterial haemorrhage; hence endovascular intervention is likely to be necessary. Many centres use angiographic sequences as part of the trauma CT scan to identify such a bleeding point as part of planning stage of endovascular management.

Affected individuals usually present with nausea and vomiting, regurgitation, dysphagia or upper abdominal pain. When stomal stenosis is found on barium studies in patients with obstructive symptoms, the band should be deflated to increase luminal calibre and relieve the patient’s symptoms. Acute pouch dilation usually results from marked stomal narrowing secondary to overfilling of the band or from distal band slippage and obstruction. In this setting, the band should be deflated to prevent further complications, including irreversible pouch dilation and progressive band slippage. Distal band slippage is thought to result from recurrent vomiting, overinflation of the band or faulty surgical technique. Malpositioning of the band is an unusual complication that occurs at the time of surgical placement, most often when this procedure is performed by an inexperienced surgeon. Band erosion into the gastric lumen is a rare but late complication of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and results from high pressures generated by the inflated band, with pressure necrosis of the adjacent gastric wall and subsequent erosion of the band into the lumen",

Accordingly, these tissues will increase in size. The adrenal findings are diagnostic of the condition, with glands that are of normal shape but increased size, with diffuse punctate calcification throughout both glands.

Between 69% and 77% of leaks involve the gastrojejunal anastomosis, but other less common sites of perforation include the gastric pouch, blind-ending jejunal stump and jejunojejunostomy.

Affected individuals may present with leucocytosis, fever, abdominal pain and tachycardia. Transient anastomotic narrowing and obstruction may occur during the early post-operative period secondary to residual oedema and spasm in this region. Upper GI examinations may reveal focal narrowing of the gastrojejunal anastomosis and thickened, irregular folds in the Roux limb abutting the anastomosis. These findings usually resolve within several days. Strictures at the gastrojejunal anastomosis have been reported in 3%–9% of patients. These strictures typically develop 4 weeks or more after surgery; they may be caused by post-surgical scarring at the anastomosis or by chronic ischaemia resulting from tension on the gastrojejunostomy.

      response: "",
      answer: "Seminoma",
      explanation: "Seminoma is the most common pure germ cell tumour. The imaging characteristics of seminomas reflect their uniform cellular nature. On US images, these tumours are generally uniformly hypoechoic. Embryonal carcinoma is the second most common histologic type of testicular tumour after seminoma. The tunica albuginea may be invaded, and the borders of the tumour are less distinct, as expected; they are more heterogeneous and ill-defined than seminomas on US image. Yolk sac tumours account for 80% of childhood testicular tumours, with most cases occurring before the age of 2 years. Imaging findings are non-specific, especially in children, in whom the only finding may be testicular enlargement without a defined mass. After yolk sac tumour, teratoma is the second most common testicular tumour in children. The complex nature of teratoma is reflected in its sonographic appearance. Teratomas generally form well-circumscribed complex masses. Cysts are a common feature and may be anechoic or complex, depending on the cyst contents (i.e., serous, mucoid or keratinous fluid). Cartilage, calcification, fibrosis and scar formation result in echogenic foci that may or may not produce posterior acoustic shadow. Testicular tumours from the sex cords (Sertoli cells) and interstitial stroma (Leydig cells) constitute 4% of tumours. Their sonographic appearance is variable and is indistinguishable from that of germ cell tumours. Sertoli cell tumours are typically well-circumscribed, unilateral, round to lobulated masses. The sonographic appearance of testicular lymphoma is variable and indistinguishable from that of germ cell tumours. Testicular lymphoma generally appears as discrete hypoechoic lesions, which may completely infiltrate the testicle",

      explanation: "Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is considered the most common malformation of the brain and face in humans. In alobar HPE, prosencephalic cleavage fails, resulting in a single midline forebrain with a primitive monoventricle often associated with a large dorsal cyst. The olfactory bulbs and tracts, the corpus callosum and anterior commissure, the cavum septum pellucidum and the interhemispheric fissure are absent, whereas the optic nerves may be normal, fused or absent. The basal ganglia, hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei are typically fused in the midline, resulting in absence of the third ventricle. In lobar HPE, the interhemispheric fissure is present along nearly the entire midline, and the thalami are completely or almost completely separated. The corpus callosum may be normal or incomplete, but the cavum septum pellucidum is always absent. Hydranencephaly is the result of a vascular insult (anterior circulation) with the cerebral hemispheres variably replaced by fluid covered with leptomeninges and dura. Falx cerebri is present. The cerebellum, midbrain, thalami, basal ganglia, choroid plexus and portions of the occipital lobes, all fed by the posterior circulation, are typically preserved.

      explanation: "The prognosis is better in postganglionic injuries, where surgical repair in the form of nerve grafting is possible. In preganglionic injuries, usually nerve root avulsions, direct surgical repair cannot be performed. A MRI scan of postganglionic injuries can show thickened nerves with a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and an increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Nerve may be in contiguity, or there can be discontinuity with distal nerve contraction. Direct brachial plexus compression by a haematoma, fracture fragment or callus formation can also cause brachial plexopathy. A MRI scan of preganglionic injuries can show nerve root avulsions with or without pseudomeningoceles. Pseudomeningoceles are cerebrospinal fluid collections resulting from a dural tear. The presence of a pseudomeningocele is a valuable sign. Spinal cord abnormalities occur in 20% of those with preganglionic injuries, such as oedema, haemorrhage and myelomalacia.

These lesions seem more likely to be associated with precocious puberty than with gelastic seizures. Intrahypothalamic hamartomas are sessile masses with a broad attachment to the hypothalamus. They lie within the hypothalamus and may distort the contour of the third ventricle. In addition, they seem to be associated more often with gelastic seizures than with precocious puberty. At MR imaging, they are seen as well-defined pedunculated or sessile lesions at the tuber cinereum and are isointense or mildly hypointense on T1-weighted images and iso- to hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with no contrast enhancement or calcification.

This has the advantage over MRI in the acute setting of being fast to acquire in a potentially unstable patient and is highly sensitive to hyperacute blood.

If the child has ongoing neurological signs/symptoms or an abnormal initial CT brain, then an MRI should be performed. This is normally done at 3–5 days. Contrast is not necessary but DWI – for ischaemia and T2* GE or similar sequence (for the detection of blood products) – should be considered.

      answer: "Comet tail sign is specific for distal ureteric calculus",
      explanation: "Most textbooks of anatomy describe the ureter as having three anatomical narrowest points. These are the pelvi-ureteric junction (PUJ), the point where the ureter crosses anterior to the iliac vessels, and the uretero-vesical junction (UVJ); however, contrary to previous teaching there is debate whether these are the most common places for stones to be lodged. Indinavir stones have soft-tissue attenuation (15–30 HU) and are likely to be missed at unenhanced CT. However, renal colic in a patient receiving indinavir therapy for HIV infection, along with the presence of obstructive features at CT, usually helps clinch the diagnosis. The most reliable signs of ureteric obstruction include hydroureter, hydronephrosis, perinephric stranding, periureteral oedema, and unilateral renal enlargement. Stones less than 5 mm have a 68% chance of passing spontaneously, and stones between 5 and 10 mm have a 47% chance. The soft-tissue rim sign consists of a halo of soft-tissue attenuation around a calcific focus and is very specific for ureteric calculi. The comet tail sign is created by an eccentric tapering soft-tissue area adjacent to a phlebolith. These two signs are used to differentiate ureteric and pelvic calcification",

      explanation: "Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder, is diagnosed by the detection of an accumulation of an abnormal form of the human prion protein PrPSc in the brain. It is characterised by rapidly progressive dementia, cerebral atrophy, myoclonus and death. The T2-weighted MRI of sCJD (sporadic CJD) patients often shows high signal in the head of the caudate nucleus and in the putamen as compared with the thalamus and the cerebral cortex. Hyperintense signal changes can also occur in the thalamus, but in sCJD they are usually less prominent than those in the putamen or the caudate nucleus. In addition, there is high signal in the cerebral cortex in some cases. With the introduction of the new sequences FLAIR and DWI, these signal changes are more easily identified. Patients with the new variant of CJD (vCJD) show bilateral increased signal on MRI in the pulvinar thalami (relative to the grey matter of other basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex). There is currently no curative treatment and the disease is invariably fatal",

      response: "",
      answer: "Brodel bloodless zone lies just anterior to the lateral convex border of the kidney",
      explanation: "Percutaneous access to the urinary tract is used to relive urinary tract obstruction and also allows the urologists to perform endourological procedures (e.g., stone removal), which is less invasive and associated with fewer complications than open surgery. The renal artery divides into the ventral and dorsal branches, which creates a zone of relative avascularity between the divisions known as the Brödel bloodless line of incision, which lies just posterior to the lateral convex border of the kidney. A lower pole posterior calix access via a subcostal approach is usually best for simple urinary drainage. A posterior calix of the upper or middle collecting system offers the easiest access to the pelviureteric junction for potential ureteral negotiation. Tubes with self-retaining properties should always be used to lessen the risk of inadvertent dislodgment. Tubes of 8–10 F are usually sufficient for drainage of non-infected urine. Larger tubes (12–14 F) may be necessary for drainage of infected urine or to ensure appropriate urine flow in procedures complicated by gross haematuria. Formal nephrostography should be delayed for 24–48 hours following tube placement in case of infected urine to reduce the chance of bacteraemia. Transient haematuria occurs in all patients post-nephrostomy. Hydrothorax and pneumothorax can also occur particularly with supracostal entries. Renal arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm or vessel laceration are recognised vascular complications during nephrostomy",

      response: "",
      answer: "Primary CNS lymphoma",
      explanation: "Toxoplasmosis typically manifests on CT scans and MRIs as nodular (small encephalitis) and/or ring-enhancing (large abscess) lesions within the brain parenchyma. The enhancing ring, when present, may be somewhat thicker and more ill-defined than that seen in association with a typical bacterial abscess. The lesions are associated with surrounding oedema and tend to be multiple at presentation. However, a significant percentage of patients present with solitary lesions. Toxoplasmic lesions are most often seen in the basal ganglia and cerebral hemispheres. On non-enhanced T1-weighted MR images, the lesions are of low signal intensity. On T2-weighted MR images, the lesions are mildly to moderately hyperintense in relation to the brain parenchyma and can be difficult to separate from the surrounding oedema. The presence of small haemorrhages may be a sign of toxoplasmosis, and calcifications can occasionally be seen in treated lesions. On CT scans and MR images, lymphoma most commonly manifests as an enhancing, space-occupying mass with surrounding oedema. However, much of the time the lesions undergo central necrosis and present as ring-enhancing masses; on non-contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images, typical lesions are isointense in relation to brain parenchyma, whereas on T2-weighted images the lesions are isointense to hyperintense. On non-enhanced CT, a small percentage of the lesions are of increased attenuation with respect to the brain parenchyma (as is commonly observed in cases of primary CNS lymphoma in patients who do not have AIDS). The imaging characteristics of lymphoma and toxoplasmosis overlap to such a significant degree that it is nearly impossible to differentiate the lesions on the basis of their appearance on CT scans or MR images alone. Patients with a few solid lesions or ring-enhancing subependymal or periventricular lesions (particularly those with subependymal extension) tend to have lymphomas, whereas patients with multiple ring-enhancing lesions (particularly those that are haemorrhagic) in the basal ganglia and cerebral hemispheres are more likely to have toxoplasmosis",

      answer: "Multilocular cystic nephroma",
      explanation: "Multilocular cystic nephroma is a benign renal tumour that occurs in children and, less commonly, adult women. There is no known association with Wilms tumour. It is usually a unilateral abnormality that replaces an entire renal pole and presents as a large mass, often around 8–10 cm in diameter. Radiological appearances, while not entirely specific, can help to differentiate this lesion from other renal mass lesions. A sharply well-circumscribed, multiseptated cystic mass is typical with a thick surrounding capsule. The cysts appear to herniate into the renal pelvis – an appearance that is relatively specific for mesoblastic nephroma. Unsurprisingly, these lesions are excised, as definitive radiological differentiation from malignancy is often not possible. Multilocular cystic nephroma can be differentiated from multicystic dysplastic kidney by the presence of normal functioning renal parenchyma and symmetrical renal excretion. Polycystic kidney disease involves the entire kidney, unlike multilocular cystic nephroma, which tends to be localised around a renal pole. Multicystic dysplastic kidney is the most common cystic renal disease affecting infants and is twice as common in boys. It is a common cause for abdominal masses in this age group and typically involves one kidney. There are strong associations with a range of genitourinary abnormalities, including vesico-ureteric reflux, horseshoe kidney and ureteric anomalies. The classical ultrasound features are as described above, with near total replacement of the normal renal parenchyma by cysts of varying size and shape. The presence of thin septations can help to differentiate this condition from multilocular cystic nephroma, in which thick septations are typical.

A painful scoliosis is a common presentation. The ‘nidus’ within the lesion is osteolytic.

Chronic histoplasmosis resembles post-primary TB, with upper lobe cavitation, calcification and fibrosis. Hilar and mediastinal nodes show calcification. Occasionally a solitary well-defined nodule may form, a so-called histoplasma. When the centre of this lesion calcifies, it forms a target lesion, which is very specific. In some cases, fibrosing mediastinitis can develop and lead to constriction of mediastinal structures, including airways, SVC, and pulmonary arteries and veins",

The condition usually manifests at the distal femur and proximal and distal ends of the tibia and fibula, and it can also affect the upper limb bones and the ribs. There are several key radiographic findings: bony spurs arising from the metaphysis of long bones are eponymously termed Pelkan spurs. Wimberger line refers to the appearance of a sclerotic line running around the perimeter of the epiphyses, which reflects osteopaenic change. Ground-glass osteoporosis and cortical thinning are also recognised findings. In contrast, rickets manifests as cupping and fraying of the metaphyses, periosteal reaction, bowing of the long bones and widening of the growth plates. Hypophosphatasia is often indistinguishable from rickets on imaging. Hypothyroidism in infancy also results in osteopaenia, with fragmentation of the epiphyses",

      response: "",
      answer: "Irregular outline to liver with caudate lobe hypertrophy",
      explanation: "In acute viral hepatitis, the major histologic findings are necrosis of random isolated liver cells or small cell clusters, diffuse liver cell injury, reactive changes in Kupffer cells and sinusoidal lining cells and an inflammatory infiltrate in portal tracts, and evidence of hepatocytic regeneration during the recovery phase. Confluent necrosis may lead to bridging necrosis connecting portal, central or portal to central regions of adjacent lobules, signifying a more severe form of acute hepatitis. The imaging features of acute hepatitis are non-specific and the diagnosis is usually based on serologic, virologic and clinical findings. Probably the most important role of radiology in patients with suspected hepatitis is to help rule out other diseases that produce similar clinical and biochemical abnormalities, such as extrahepatic cholestasis, diffuse metastatic disease and cirrhosis. At US, in acute hepatitis, the liver is often enlarged and may demonstrate a diffuse decrease in parenchymal echogenicity, which causes a relative increase in the echogenicity of the portal vein walls (‘starry night’ pattern). A normal liver echotexture does not exclude the diagnosis of acute hepatitis. At CT and MR imaging, findings in acute viral hepatitis are non-specific and include hepatomegaly and periportal oedema. At CT, heterogeneous enhancement and well-defined regions of low attenuation may be present. At MR imaging, periportal oedema appears as high-signal-intensity areas on T2-weighted images. Involved areas may be normal or demonstrate decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Extrahepatic findings in patients with severe acute hepatitis include gallbladder wall thickening due to oedema and, infrequently, ascites",

      answer: "Testicular fracture requires urgent surgical exploration",
      explanation: "Testicular fracture usually appears as a linear hypoechoic band extending across the testicular parenchyma. The contour remains smooth and the shape of the testicle is maintained. The tunica albuginea is intact. An associated haematocele or testicular haematoma may be seen. The fracture line may not be visible if filled with isoechoic haematoma. Testicular fractures are treated conservatively if normal flow is identified in the surrounding testicular parenchyma. In testicular rupture there is discontinuity of the echogenic tunica albuginea with haemorrhage and extrusion of testicular contents into the scrotal sac. This is an indication for emergency scrotal exploration to salvage the testis. US shows poorly defined testicular margins and heterogeneous echotexture, with areas of haemorrhage or infarction. Intratesticular haematomas are usually focal and fairly well defined and may be multiple. They are usually hyperechoic in the acute phase or hypoechoic (as the haemorrhage evolves) and lack vascularity. Isolated epididymal injuries are not very common, and these are usually associated with testicular injuries. Contusion or traumatic epididymitis appears as an enlarged and heterogeneous epididymis on US with increased vascularity, sometimes associated with haematocele.

      answer: "Chronic ulnar collateral ligament injury",
      explanation: "Injury to the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL), also known as the medial collateral ligament or medial ulnar collateral ligament, is a common cause of medial elbow pain and valgus instability in athletes. The UCL is made of anterior, transverse and posterior bundles, and is most often injured following acute or recurrent valgus stress of the elbow. MRI may demonstrate increased T2-weighted signal within the ligament (commonly within the anterior band) or hyperintensity within the sublime tubercle. Intra-articular contrast may result in a ‘T sign’ when contrast extends in the interval between the sublime tubercle and stripped ligamentous attachment; complete rupture will show extravasation of contrast through the ligamentous defect. Chronic valgus stress, often secondary to throwing or pitching sports, can result in chronic damage to the UCL, with appearances similar to those described and the UCL often appearing lax, irregular and with poor definition. Plain radiograph findings may include heterotopic new bone formation around the medial epicondyle and local subchondral cysts, sclerosis and osteophyte formation. The differential diagnosis includes medial epicondylitis and a sublime tubercle fracture. Lateral ulnar collateral ligament forms part of the lateral ligament complex and presents with symptoms of lateral or postero-lateral elbow pain/instability",

      answer: "The severity of the skin rash correlates with the degree of articular abnormalities",
      explanation: "If there is joint space narrowing, signs of inflammation, multiple joint involvement and distal involvement in the hands and feet with added features of bone proliferation, a seronegative spondyloarthropathy is suggested. Approximately 10%–15% of patients with skin manifestations of psoriasis will develop psoriatic arthritis. Usually such manifestations will precede the development of arthritis. The hallmarks of psoriatic arthritis, similar to those of the other seronegative spondyloarthropathies, are signs of inflammatory arthritis combined with bone proliferation, periostitis, enthesitis and a distal joint distribution in the extremities. Involvement of several joints in a single digit, with soft-tissue swelling, produces what appears clinically as a ‘sausage digit’. The bone proliferation produces an irregular and indistinct appearance to the marginal bone about the involved joint, characterised as a ‘fuzzy’ appearance or ‘whiskering’. Periostitis may take several forms. It may appear as a thin periosteal layer of new bone adjacent to the cortex, a thick irregular layer or irregular thickening of the cortex itself. Because of the degree of bone destruction, an involved joint may take the appearance of a ‘pencil and cup’, with one end of the joint forming a cup and the other a pencil that projects into this cup. One characteristic feature of psoriatic arthritis in the foot is the ‘ivory phalanx’, which classically involves the distal phalanges (especially in the first digit). Sacroiliac joint involvement in psoriatic arthritis is usually bilateral, either symmetric or asymmetric in distribution. The thoracolumbar spine may show large comma-shaped paravertebral ossifications. There is no association between the dermatological extent of psoriasis and the musculoskeletal manifestations",

US is the primary modality for assessment of the abdomen in children. The most accurate US finding for acute appendicitis is an outer-wall diameter greater than 6 mm under compression. Less sensitive and specific US findings for appendicitis include hyperaemia within the appendiceal wall on colour Doppler images, echogenic inflamed periappendiceal fat and the presence of an appendicolith.

      explanation: "Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by chronic hepatitis infection or alcohol abuse, although a number of other diseases causing hepatic injury can lead to cirrhosis. It is pathologically defined by three main characteristics: fibrosis, nodular transformation and distortion of hepatic architecture. Subtle morphologic changes of the liver may be among the earliest detectable with imaging, including enlargement of the hilar periportal space, enlargement of the major interlobar fissure and expansion of pericholecystic space or gallbladder fossa. Typically, the anterior segment of the right lobe and medial segment of the left lobe atrophy, whereas the caudate lobe and left lateral segment hypertrophy. The nodular changes in cirrhosis yield characteristic radiologic findings. The nodularity is best seen affecting the liver margin, especially on the left lateral segment. Micronodular cirrhosis, common in alcoholic liver disease, gives rise to a fine cobblestone appearance resulting from nodules typically smaller than 3 mm. A grossly nodular liver margin with 3–15-mm regenerative nodules is characteristic of macronodular cirrhosis, more commonly associated with viral hepatitis. Other changes in cirrhosis include diffuse heterogeneity of the organ on CT and T1- and T2-weighted MRI. Fibrosis is the predominant cause for hepatic heterogeneity and appears high in signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI",

The differentiation of these lesions is important because regenerative nodules are benign, whereas dysplastic and neoplastic nodules are premalignant and malignant, respectively. However, their accurate characterisation may be difficult even at histopathologic analysis. Comparing the clinical and pathologic findings with radiologic imaging features may facilitate differential diagnosis; in particular, nodule size, vascularity, hepatocellular function and Kupffer cell density assessed at MRI are suggestive of the correct diagnosis. MRI is more useful than CT for such assessments because it provides better soft-tissue contrast and a more nuanced depiction of different tissue properties. Moreover, a wider variety of contrast agents is available for use in MR imaging. Familiarity with the MR imaging characteristics of cirrhosis-associated hepatocellular nodules is therefore important for optimal diagnosis and management of cirrhotic disease",

      response: "",
      answer: "Large flowing osteophytes",
      explanation: "Sacroiliac involvement is typically bilateral and symmetric, and it usually precedes spinal involvement in ankylosing spondylitis. Initially, there is indistinctness and discontinuity of the thin white subchondral bone plate about the sacroiliac joints. These changes can progress to gross bone erosions. Early erosions of the subchondral bone are often best seen in the inferior aspect of the joints. Along with the bone erosions, the adjacent bone is often sclerotic and joint space narrowing and bone fusion eventually occur. The differential diagnosis of bilateral sacroiliac joint erosions includes inflammatory bowel disease and hyperparathyroidism; however, in hyperparathyroidism, sacroiliac joint space widening is more dramatic. Early radiographic findings are erosions at the anterior margins of the vertebral body at the discovertebral junction. These focal areas of osteitis become increasingly sclerotic, a finding termed the ‘shiny corner sign’. More extensive discovertebral erosions may also occur (Anderson lesion). lender syndesmophytes are generally evident, representing ossification of the outer layer of the annulus fibrosis. The differential diagnosis for bone production at the vertebral margins includes diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, or DISH, although this latter condition more commonly reveals a flowing and undulating appearance. As the syndesmophytes thicken and become continuous, the term bamboo spine is used on anteroposterior lumbar spine radiographs. Facet joint inflammation leads to indistinctness and narrowing of the involved joint, and bone fusion of the joints appears later. Ossification of the posterior interspinous ligaments produces a dense radiopaque line, designated the ‘dagger sign’, on anteroposterior radiographs of the lumbar spine. The combination of the fused facets and ossification of the interspinous ligaments produces the ‘trolley-track sign’. Disk calcification may also occur. Other peripheral joints can be involved in ankylosing spondylitis. Hip involvement is usually bilateral in distribution",

      stem: "A 43-year-old woman on bromocriptine for pituitary adenoma presents to the A&E department with severe headache, stiff neck, visual symptoms and obtundation. CT shows increased density in the sella, but it is not diagnostic. MRI of the brain shows significant enlargement of the pituitary with high signal on T1W images. What is the diagnosis?",

      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Pituitary apoplexy",
      explanation: "Pituitary apoplexy is a severe and potentially fatal medical condition characterised by the variable association of headache, vomiting, visual impairment, ophthalmoplegia, altered mental state and panhypopituitarism. The syndrome is often related to haemorrhagic infarction of the pituitary gland, usually in a condition of a pre-existing macroadenoma. CT typically a heterogeneously hyperdense (haemorrhagic components) intrasellar lesion, with significant increase in size in comparison to previous imaging. MRI shows a similar finding, with the appearance of blood varying on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, based on the interval between haemorrhage and imaging. In the subacute phase (7–21 days), methaemoglobin shortens the T1 relaxation time, and the haemorrhage will appear hyperintense on T1-weighted images as well as on T2-weighted images. In the chronic phase (>21 days), macrophages digest the clot and the presence of haemosiderin and ferritine causes a strong hypointensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images",

      answer: "Traumatic diaphragmatic rupture",
      explanation: "The presenting features include respiratory distress, tracheal deviation and dullness to percussion on one side. Motor vehicle accidents are the cause of traumatic diaphragm rupture in 90% of cases, with falls from height and a kick to the abdomen or object falling on the abdomen as alternative aetiologies. The initial chest X-ray is abnormal in 40%–90% of cases. It may show irregularity or obscuring of the leaf of the diaphragm, fractured ribs, mediastinal shift, intrapleural fluid or detectable viscera within the thorax. The most important radiological sign is incomplete visualisation of the entire diaphragm",

      response: "",
      answer: "The accordion sign is classic in Crohn’s disease",
      explanation: "Several patterns of wall attenuation have been described in association with specific diseases. A hyperattenuating wall is seen with haemorrhage as a result of trauma, purpura or vasculitis. A submucosal fatty halo has been described as a result of chronic inflammation, such as in inflammatory bowel disease and GVHD. Submucosal oedema is definitive evidence of a bowel wall injury (typically acute), often producing the target sign. The accordion sign is caused by contrast material trapped between thickened oedematous haustral folds in the colon. Although the accordion sign is most commonly seen in pseudomembranous colitis, it is not pathognomonic. The comb sign represents hypervascular engorged vasa recta aligned like the teeth of a comb on the mesenteric site of the bowel. This finding is classically seen in inflammatory bowel disease, especially Crohn’s disease, and suggests a clinically active disease. The comb sign can also be seen in vasculitis and purpura. The toothpaste or lead pipe sign has been associated with chronic diseases leading to a ‘featureless’ bowel. It is commonly seen with Crohn’s disease or chronic GVHD or as the sequela of radiation therapy",
