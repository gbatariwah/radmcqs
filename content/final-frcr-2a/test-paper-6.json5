      response: "",
      answer: "Pneumatocoeles do not cause mediastinal shift",
      explanation: "Pneumatocoeles typically are post-infectious or post-traumatic, discrete, thin-walled, gas-containing collections within the lung parenchyma. They also may result from positive pressure ventilation–related barotrauma and ingestion of caustic material (e.g. hydrocarbons). Post-infectious pneumatocoeles most frequently complicate staphylococcal pneumonia and occur in infants. They typically appear within 1 week of onset of infection and most spontaneously disappear within weeks to months after the infection has resolved. Rarely, persistent pneumatocoeles may require percutaneous catheter drainage or surgical management. Post-traumatic pneumatocoeles result from blunt trauma. Such pneumatocoeles are typically observed within hours of the trauma and spontaneously resolve within 3 weeks. They generally spare the lung apices. At CT, pneumatocoeles appear as well-defined parenchymal cystic structures, with a thin wall. They may be entirely filled with gas, or an air–fluid level may be seen. Contralateral mediastinal shift may be seen with large pneumatocoeles. They are associated with contusion in blunt trauma and can rupture to cause pneumothorax",

      answer: "Appendix",
      explanation: "Carcinoid tumours are the most common primary tumour of the small bowel and appendix. Gastrointestinal carcinoids account for about 85% of all carcinoid tumours, with the remaining 15% occurring in the lungs and bronchi. These tumours arise from the enterochromaffin cells of Kultchitsky; these express serotonin and other histamine-like substances. The appendix is the most common site of carcinoids, accounting for 30%–45%, the small bowel for 25%–35%, the rectum 10%–15%, the colon 5% and the stomach <3%. Most tumours are clinically silent but may cause pain, obstruction, weight loss and, rarely, bowel perforation. In rare cases (7% of small bowel carcinoids), the hormonal load from the tumour may overwhelm the liver’s capacity to metabolise serotonin, causing a carcinoid syndrome–recurrent diarrhoea, right-sided endocardial fibroelastosis, wheezing/bronchospasm and flushing of the face and neck",

      response: "",
      answer: "Inflammatory pseudotumour",
      explanation: "Inflammatory pseudotumour is an interesting entity that has been reported in every organ of the body. At imaging, it usually appears as a solitary exophytic or polypoid bladder mass, which may be ulcerated. On T2-weighted MRI, it is heterogeneous, with a central hyperintense component surrounded by a low-signal-intensity periphery; on post-contrast images the periphery enhances, whereas the central region enhances poorly. The central region consists of necrotic tissue, and the periphery comprises fascicles of spindle cells in oedematous stroma with myxoid components, vessels and inflammatory cells (hence the name pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumour). This structure may produce the pattern of ring-like enhancement observed on CT and MR images suggestive of the diagnosis, but histologic confirmation is essential. In young adults, the presence of luminal clot surrounding an enhancing bladder mass may also suggest this diagnosis. MRI shows single or multiple masses. On T2-weighted images, cystitis glandularis shows low signal intensity with a central branching high-signal pattern. The hyperintense area shows the most contrast enhancement and corresponds to the vascular stalk. Eosinophilic cystitis nodules are hyperintense to muscle on T1, isointense on T2-weighted images, and enhanced after intravenous contrast administration",

      answer: "Discitis",
      explanation: "Pyogenic spondylitis most commonly involves the lumbar spine and one spinal segment, which consists of two vertebral bodies and the intervening disk. It typically displays low signal intensity on T1-weighted images, with a loss of definition of the vertebral end plate and of the adjacent vertebral bodies and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In the involved disk space, fluid-like signal intensity is seen on both T1 and T2 images. Following the intravenous administration of gadolinium-based contrast material, disk enhancement patterns from homogeneous to patchy non-confluent to peripheral enhancement may be seen. Infected bone marrow also enhances diffusely after contrast material is administered; contrast-enhanced fat-suppressed MR images are especially useful in demonstrating this marrow abnormality. MR imaging provides better definition of epidural extension of the inflammatory process and compression of the spinal cord and dural sac than other imaging modalities do. Paravertebral and epidural extension may appear in the form of either a phlegmon or an abscess with mixed signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images",

      explanation: "The question describes the Carney triad: pulmonary chondroma, gastric GIST and multiple extra-adrenal neuroblastoma. Cancer predisposition syndrome (CPS) is the term that is generally reserved to describe familial cancers in which a clear mode of inheritance can be established. Individuals may present with one or more key physical features or congenital anomalies (e.g. hemihypertrophy). Patients may have specific tumours that are known to be highly associated with a CPS (e.g. haemangioblastomas in VHL (Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome) disease). Some physical features suggesting CPS are café-au-lait spots (NF1, NF2, Bloom’s), angiofibromas (tuberous sclerosis, TS), pits in palms and soles (Gorlin), macrocephaly (Sotos, Cowden, Gorlin), macroglosia [BWS ( (Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome)], hyperpigmentation (NF1, Fanconi anaemia, Blooms), spotty skin pigmentation (Carney complex), hemihypertrophy (NF1, BWS, Klippel–Trénaunay syndrome), thumb malformation (Fanconi anaemia), aniridia [WAGR (Wilms tumor- anirida syndrome with genitourinary anomalies)] and so on. Tumours associated with CPS include Wilms tumour (WAGR, BWS and several others), haemangioblastoma (VHL), clear cell renal carcinoma (VHL, TS), pheochromocytoma (VHL, MEN 2B, NF1), hepatoblastoma (BWS, Familial adenomatous polyposis, FAP), adrenocortical and breast carcinoma (Li–Fraumeni syndrome, LFS), optic glioma and neurofibrosarcoma (NF1), retinoblastoma (familial retinoblastoma), gastric cancer and GIST (FAP, NF1, Carney triad, HNPCC [hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer] or lynch syndrome, LFS, MEN1), neuroblastoma (NF1, BWS), rhabdomyosarcoma (LFS, NF1, BWS, hereditary retinoblastoma) and so on. Screening tests and pathways have been established for several of these CPSs. These include US abdomen for BWS, LFS, FAP and VHL; prophylactic thyroidectomy for MEN 2; and so on",

      response: "",
      answer: "Normal lung reduces in T2 intensity as it matures",
      explanation: "At US, the foetal lungs normally appear homogeneous and are slightly more echogenic than the liver. The echogenicity of the lung increases as gestation advances. The presence of cysts or focal increased echogenicity of the lung parenchyma indicates a mass. The axis of the heart is determined relative to the interventricular septum. At MR imaging, the trachea, bronchi and lungs demonstrate high T2 signal intensity relative to the chest wall muscles, because they contain a significant amount of fluid. As the lungs mature, there is increasing production of alveolar fluid, thereby increasing the T2 signal intensity of lung relative to the liver. Pulmonary hypoplasia can be primary or secondary. Primary pulmonary hypoplasia is less common. The most common intrathoracic cause of secondary pulmonary hypoplasia is congenital diaphragmatic hernia. The herniated liver can be confused with a mass originating in the lung. Colour Doppler imaging may be helpful in identifying the portal and hepatic veins. Meconium-filled large bowel is hyperintense on T1-weighted images and hypointense on T2-weighted images; therefore, intrathoracic herniation of the large bowel can easily be detected at MR imaging. The most common extrathoracic cause of pulmonary hypoplasia is severe oligohydramnios, secondary to either foetal urogenital anomaly or premature rupture of membranes",

Fracture involvement of the anterior and posterior columns is characterised by disruption of the iliopectineal line and ilioischial line, respectively.

The HU (Hounsfield Unit) value of the cystic lesion is variable from water density to soft-tissue density depending on the volume of mucin present within it. A CT scan is good at demonstrating the curvilinear or punctate rim-like calcification that is present in approximately 50% of cases. Ultrasound may demonstrate a right lower quadrant lesion with either cystic or mixed internal echogenicity depending on the amount of mucin. Rupture of mucocoeles may lead to pseudomyxoma peritonei with characteristic findings of multiple thin-walled cystic masses of varying sizes in the abdomen, scalloping of the liver and splenic margins and a gelatinous ascites.

      explanation: "Spinal tuberculosis most commonly involves the thoracic spine and less often the lumbar spine. It is often difficult to differentiate between tuberculous and pyogenic spondylitis, both clinically and on images. MR imaging is very helpful for differentiating between tuberculous spondylitis and pyogenic spondylitis. A well-defined paraspinal mass with abnormal signal intensity; a thin, smooth abscess wall; subligamentous spread to three or more vertebral levels; and multiple vertebral or entire-body involvement are findings more suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis than of pyogenic spondylitis. The presence of skip lesions and of a large paraspinal cold abscess is also suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis. However, because they barely penetrate the anterior longitudinal ligament, neither an anterior paraspinal phlegmon or an abscess encasing the intercostal arteries, is seen in spinal tuberculosis. MR imaging is less sensitive than radiography or CT for identifying paraspinal calcifications, which are a distinctive imaging feature of spinal tuberculosis.

Benign fibrous cortical defects and non-ossifying fibromas are the most common tumours in the benign fibrous group. Benign cortical defects and non-ossifying fibromas are eccentric, cortical bone lesions, usually located in the metaphyses of long bones. Non-ossifying fibromas are usually larger than fibrous cortical defects. The most common locations for fibrous cortical defects are the distal femur, proximal tibia and distal tibia.

      explanation: "Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is the most common manifestation of CNS tuberculosis across all age groups. The typical radiographic finding is abnormal meningeal enhancement, usually most pronounced in the basal cisterns. These findings are better seen at gadolinium-enhanced MR imaging than at CT. Appearances usually resolve relatively quickly with adequate treatment; however, radiographic resolution is delayed if there are thickened exudates. This appearance is non-specific and has a wide differential diagnosis that includes meningitis from other infective agents; inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and sarcoidosis; and neoplastic causes, both primary and secondary. The presence of high density within the basal cisterns on non-contrast CT scans is a very specific sign for TBM in children. The most common complication of tuberculous meningitis is communicating hydrocephalus. Ischaemic infarcts are also common, being seen in 20%–40% of patients at CT, mostly within the basal ganglia or internal capsule resulting from vascular compression and occlusion of small perforating vessels. Cranial nerve (2, 3, 4 and 7) involvement is reported",

Pincer-type impingement is the acetabular cause of FAI and is secondary to either focal or generalised over-coverage of the femoral head by the acetabulum. Cam-type impingement is the femoral cause and is secondary to an asphericity of the femoral head and offset of the femoral head–neck junction. Cam impingement is more common in young men and leads to a increased alpha angle (diagnostic > 55 degrees). The osseous bump at the head–neck junction may be located laterally, resulting in the ‘pistol grip’ deformity seen on AP pelvis. Protrusio acetabuli occurs when the femoral head is overlapping the ilioischial line medially and may be idiopathic or secondary to causes such as rheumatoid arthritis, Paget disease Marfans syndrome and osteomalacia",

      explanation: "The sonographic findings of an impacted gallstone within the neck of bladder causing proximal biliary dilatation are diagnostic for Mirizzi syndrome. Mirizzi syndrome is caused by impaction of a large gallstone in the cystic duct, cystic duct remnant or gallbladder neck. The impacted stone causes external compression of the CBD, resulting in proximal dilation of the biliary tree. A choledochocoele is cystic dilatation of the CBD within the lumen of the duodenum. Caroli disease is a congenital disorder characterised by saccular dilatations of intrahepatic ducts. Caroli disease, in association with congenital hepatic fibrosis, polycystic kidney disease and others, is known as Caroli syndrome",

Superior orbital fissure syndrome is caused by extension of the fracture through the superior orbital fissure, with resultant injury to cranial nerves III, IV, V1 (the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve) and VI as they traverse the fissure into the orbit, thus causing ophthalmoplegia or diplopia (extra-ocular muscle paralysis) and ptosis (paralysis of the levator palpebrae superioris, which is supplied by cranial nerve III).

      answer: "Second branchial cleft cyst",
      explanation: "The vast majority (95%) of branchial cleft anomalies arise from the second cleft. At least three-fourths of these anomalies are cysts, which typically occur between 10 and 40 years of age, in contrast to fistulas or sinuses, which manifest most commonly during the first decade of life. No gender predilection has been reported. These cysts usually appear as painless, fluctuant masses in the lateral portion of the neck adjacent to the anteromedial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle at the mandibular angle. The mass enlarges slowly over time and may become painful and tender if secondarily infected. At US, a second branchial cleft cyst is seen as a sharply marginated, round to ovoid, centrally anechoic mass with a thin peripheral wall that displaces the surrounding soft tissues. The mass is compressible and shows distinct acoustic enhancement. Occasionally, fine, indistinct internal echoes, representing debris, may be seen. The ‘classic’ location of these cysts (at either CT or MR imaging) is at the anteromedial border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, lateral to the carotid space and at the posterior margin of the submandibular gland. The cyst typically displaces the sternocleidomastoid muscle posteriorly or posterolaterally, pushes the vessels of the carotid space medially or posteromedial and displaces the submandibular gland anteriorly. It may also be seen more medially within the parapharyngeal space after extending through the stylomandibular tunnel and middle constrictor muscle. MR imaging better depicts the deep tissue extent of a second branchial cleft cyst, which allows accurate preoperative planning. The cyst fluid varies from hypointense to slightly hyperintense relative to muscle on T1-weighted images and is usually hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Mural thickness and enhancement vary, depending of the presence and severity of any associated inflammatory process. Occasionally, a ‘beak sign’ may be seen on axial CT or MR images. This sign represents a curved rim of tissue or ‘beak’ pointing medially between the internal and external carotid arteries. It is considered a pathognomonic imaging feature of a second branchial cleft cyst",

At US, the finding of an anechoic mass with a thin outer wall in this characteristic location easily establishes the diagnosis of a thyroglossal duct cyst. However, this ‘classic’ appearance is seen in less than half (42%) of cases. More commonly, these cysts manifest as hypoechoic masses, often with increased through-transmission. They may be either homogeneous or heterogeneous in appearance with variable degrees of fine to coarse internal echoes. There is no correlation between the sonographic appearance and pathologic evidence of infection and inflammation. Heterogeneity seen in thyroglossal duct cysts on sonograms is more likely due to the proteinaceous content of the fluid secreted from the cyst wall rather than to infection. Preoperative sonographic visualisation of normal thyroid tissue is sufficient to exclude a diagnosis of ectopic thyroid tissue and obviates routine thyroid scintigraphy",

Clinical manifestations include facial and neck swelling, distended neck veins, headache due to cerebral oedema, dyspnoea, stridor and altered mental status. Cancer is the most common underlying cause of superior vena cava obstruction and this includes lung cancer, mediastinal tumours, lymphoma/lymphadenopathy and mesothelioma, either directly or through malignant mediastinal lymphadenopathy. Other causes include catheter-induced iatrogenic SVC obstruction, fibrosing mediastinitis and Behcet’s disease",

It is a heterogeneous condition: for example, it can cause incontinence owing to detrusor over-activity, difficulty in passing urine owing to detrusor underactivity or retention with overflow incontinence. Most commonly, the bladder eventually becomes trabeculated with decreased capacity, but very large atonic bladders can also be seen. The detrusor muscle is innervated by the sympathetic nerves originating from S2–S4, therefore, neurogenic bladder is a common problem in spinal trauma.

Benign sacrococcygeal teratomas are predominantly cystic; have attenuation similar to that of fluid on CT scans; and may include bone, fat and calcification. Cystic areas typically have the appearance of fluid on T1-weighted and T2-weighted MR images. Areas of fatty tissue demonstrate high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, whereas calcification and bone are depicted as areas of signal void. The coccyx is always involved, even in benign sacrococcygeal teratoma. Malignant teratomas have a predominant solid component, and haemorrhage and necrosis are common. Enteric cysts are rare and may arise in locations between the rectum and sacrum. They are classified according to their histologic basis as either tail-gut cysts or rectal duplication cysts. Duplication cysts on MR imaging demonstrates well-marginated, thin-walled lesions with low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Mucoid contents of tail-gut cysts cause them to have high signal intensity on T1-weighted images. On MR images, cystic lymphatic malformations appear as areas of homogeneous high signal intensity on T2-weighted images and have the signal intensity of fluid on T1-weighted images. A fluid–fluid level can be seen in the setting of acute haemorrhage",

      explanation: "The overwhelmingly important diagnosis not to be missed in this scenario is ascending cholangitis. This is because ascending cholangitis needs immediate treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and biliary drainage via either cholecystectomy or acute laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Although a sonographic-positive Murphy’s sign and pericholecystic free fluid suggest a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis, this should not distract the clinician from the presence of cholangitis, which is confirmed by the presence of fever and jaundice and is primarily a clinical diagnosis rather than a radiological one. Acute cholecystitis is not a clinical emergency and in this case is an associated finding that likely predates ascending cholangitis",

OKCs develop from the dental lamina, which is found throughout the jaw and overlying alveolar mucosa and is lined by stratified keratinising squamous epithelium. Thus, the cysts can occur throughout periapical or primordial regions. Unlike follicular cysts, OKCs can expand cortical bone and erode the cortex. Fortunately, malignant transformation of these lesions is rare. The lesion is multiloculated, often with daughter cysts that extend to the surrounding bone. Multiple OKCs in a young patient should raise the possibility of basal cell nevus syndrome (Gorlin–Goltz syndrome).

Physiological periosteal new bone formation is seen in up to a third of infants during the first few months of life. They are benign, usually symmetric and involve the long bones (femur, tibia and humerus). Radiographs demonstrate one or more dense lines of periosteal reaction along the diaphyses. Pathologic bone formation generally results from an adjacent inflammatory process or a hypoxic or toxic stimulus. Common causes of pathologic periosteal reaction in children include trauma to the underlying bone. However, other causes such as hypervitaminosis A, prostaglandin therapy, cortical hyperostosis (Caffey’s disease), hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (primary and secondary), osteomyelitis, leukaemia, trauma and syphilis must also be considered.

Enhancement of less than 15 Hounsfield units strongly favours benignity, whereas enhancement of greater than 15 Hounsfield units could represent malignancy or an inflammatory process. A peripheral rim of enhancement implies benignity but can occur with cavitating tumours such as squamous cell carcinoma. A flattened nodule (axial: craniocaudal diameter ratio of >1.78:1) is also indicative of a benign aetiology, as is central calcification.

Fibroid passage is one such complication; this is defined as detachment of the treated uterine fibroid. An increased risk of fibroid passage is seen in fibroids abutting the endometrial cavity (e.g. submucosal fibroids). Fibroid passage can precipitate severe pain, infection or recurrent bleeding.

      response: "",
      answer: "Homolateral Lisfranc fracture dislocation",
      explanation: "Lisfranc injury is a fracture dislocation of the tarso-metatarsal joints in a dorsolateral direction. The second metatarsal is held in a mortise formed by the medial and lateral cuneiform bones. Transverse metatarsal ligaments, both on the plantar and dorsal surfaces, connect the second to fifth metatarsals proximally. There is no transverse ligament between the first and second metatarsal. The plantar ligaments are stronger; hence most dislocations occur dorsally. If there is medial dislocation of the first metatarsal and lateral dislocation of the remaining metatarsals, it is considered a divergent type of Lisfranc injury. If the alignment of the first metatarsal is normal, or if it displaces laterally along with the remaining metatarsals, it is considered the homolateral type. On AP radiography of the foot, the medial aspect of the second metatarsal and middle cuneiform bone should align and, on the oblique view, the medial aspect of the third metatarsal and the lateral cuneiform bone should align. March fracture is another name for stress fracture, which commonly occurs at the distal shafts of the second and third metatarsals. They may appear on plain radiograph as a lucent line or their presence may be noted secondary to faint periosteal reaction or callus formation. If not visible on plain films and clinical suspicion persists, MRI or radionuclide scan may be helpful. Lover’s fracture is another term for fracture of the calcaneus. Jones fracture occurs in the proximal shaft of the fifth metatarsal. It has a high rate of non-union and is found within 1.5 cm of the fifth metatarsal tuberosity",

      explanation: "Cholesteatomas can be classified as either congenital or acquired, though the origins are indistinguishable with histology and imaging. Only the location of the lesion, the clinical history of the patient, and the otologic status of the tympanic membrane (TM) give some idea how to differentiate these two types of cholesteatomas. Congenital cholesteatomas develop from embryonic epithelial rests and can be located anywhere in the temporal bone: in the middle ear, in the mastoid, in the petrous apex in the squama of the temporal bone, within the TM or in the external auditary canal (EAC). Furthermore, the same histologic entity can arise in other areas of the skull, in the extracranial soft tissues or in an intracranial extra-axial location, where it is referred to as epidermoid cyst. Middle ear congenital cholesteatomas represent approximately 2% of all middle ear cholesteatomas. Primary acquired cholesteatomas (80% of all middle ear cholesteatomas) develop behind an apparently intact TM, usually in the region of the pars flaccida. Secondary acquired cholesteatomas (18% of all middle ear cholesteatomas) grow into the middle ear through a perforated TM, usually through the pars tensa and sometimes the pars flaccida. Pars flaccida (attic) cholesteatomas are located at the upper one-third portion of the TM. Pars tensa (sinus) cholesteatomas develop most often through a defect of the lower two-thirds portion of the TM",

When a destructive mass in the nasal septum extends into the orbits, Wegener’s granulomatosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Intracranial involvement may also result, usually in the anterior cranial fossa, owing to the spread of the disease through the cribriform plate. As the disease becomes chronic, the walls of the residual paranasal sinuses (particularly the maxillary sinuses) become markedly thickened while the sinus volume is gradually reduced, and the nasal septum may completely disappear",

Part I The following are general recommendations for nodules 1.0 cm or greater in largest diameter: Solitary nodule: Strongly consider FNA for (1) a nodule 1.0 cm or more in largest diameter if microcalcifications are present and (2) a nodule 1.5 cm or more in largest diameter if any of the following apply: (a) nodule is solid or almost entirely solid or (b) there are coarse calcifications within the nodule. Consider FNA for (1) a nodule 2.0 cm or more in largest diameter if any of the following apply: (a) the nodule is mixed solid and cystic or (b) the nodule is almost entirely cystic with a solid mural component; or (2) the nodule has shown substantial growth since prior US examination. FNA is likely unnecessary if the nodule is almost entirely cystic, in the absence of the above-listed features. Multiple nodules: Consider FNA of one or more nodules, with selection prioritised on the basis of the previously stated criteria in the order listed above. FNA is likely unnecessary in diffusely enlarged glands with multiple nodules of similar US appearance without intervening normal parenchyma. Note that these recommendations are not absolute or inflexible. In certain circumstances, the physician’s clinical judgment may lead him or her to determine that FNA need not be performed for nodules that meet the recommendations above. In others, FNA may be appropriate for nodules that do not meet the criteria listed above. Part II The recommendation for non-diagnostic aspirates from initial FNA is as follows: Consider a second FNA of nodules meeting the criteria for FNA of solitary nodules, as outlined above. Part III The presence of abnormal lymph nodes overrides the US features criteria and should prompt biopsy of the lymph node and/or (if necessary) of an ipsilateral thyroid nodule",

Lifting of the clavicle above the superior border of the acromion implies a severe strain injury with typical complete derangement of the internal attachments and stabilising structures (Grade III injury).

      answer: "Carcinoid syndrome",
      explanation: "Carcinoid syndrome is a collection of symptoms that are caused by a small proportion of carcinoid tumours. This nearly always occurs following metastasis to the liver, although it can happen if a carcinoid tumour occurs outside the gut and its excreted chemicals (adrenocorticotropic hormone, histamine, serotonin, etc.) bypass liver metabolism. These chemicals cause recurrent diarrhoea, bronchospasm, flushing and right-sided heart failure. A spiculated mesenteric mass with calcification and a desmoplastic effect on the adjacent bowel in a patient with these symptoms is characteristic of carcinoid syndrome. These tumours are often hyperintense on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging as they are very vascular. They also produce hypervascular metastases. If there is carcinoid syndrome, the carcinoid tumour is usually located in small bowel. Malignant melanomas are often bright on T1 and do not usually give a desmoplastic mesenteric reaction or give flushing. Cholangiocarcinomas produce hypervascular liver metastases but mesenteric deposits are unusual and the biliary tree appeared normal in this case. Retractile mesenteritis would not cause liver lesions. Mesenteric abscesses from cholecystitis would be rare and only the rim should enhance with gadolinium.

      answer: "Stress fracture of the femoral neck involves the superior surface",
      explanation: "The most common cause of stress fractures is a chronic and repeated workload. Children with extremity malalignment or abnormal weight-bearing also are at increased risk. Typical locations of stress fractures in children include the tibia, fibula, femur and tarsal and metatarsal bones. MR imaging is currently the best diagnostic modality for stress fractures. Stress fractures of the femur tend to occur after skeletal maturity and resemble adult injuries, affecting the inferior surface of the neck, the shaft and the distal metaphysis. This injury is most common in endurance athletes, such as runners, triathletes or soccer players but also occurs in association with abnormal weight-bearing, such as with a coxa vara deformity. The most common site for stress fractures in the adolescent athlete is the tibia. Tibial stress fractures occur with activities requiring sudden stops or changes in direction, such as football, soccer and tennis. Stress also can result in shin splints, which are probably an early stress response secondary to periosteal traction. In cases of stress fractures, MR imaging shows diffuse and irregular bone marrow oedema, whereas in shin splints, the area of high signal intensity often is more linear and is limited to the medial aspect of the tibia. Spondylolysis is a stress injury of the pars interarticularis that is due to repetitive extension and torsion of the trunk. Usually occurring in the lower segments of the lumbar spine, stress injuries of the pars interarticularis have been observed in young female gymnasts, college football players and wrestlers",

      response: "",
      answer: "Destruction of underlying bone is normally seen at presentation on plain radiography",
      explanation: "If joint inflammation is limited to a single joint, infection must first be carefully excluded. The cause of septic arthritis is usually related to haematogenous seeding owing to staphylococcal or streptococcal microorganisms. The radiographic features of a septic joint encompass those of any inflammatory arthritis – namely, periarticular osteopenia, uniform joint space narrowing, soft-tissue swelling and bone erosions. Not all findings may be present simultaneously, and, acutely, bone erosions may not be evident. Furthermore, the joint space may be initially widened owing to the effusion. Joint space widening may also be seen with more indolent and atypical infections, such as those related to tuberculosis and fungal agents. The Phemister triad describes these findings classically seen in tuberculous arthritis: juxta-articular osteopenia, peripheral bone erosions and gradual narrowing of the joint space. The presence of anterior capsular distension was noted as convexity of the anterior recess and compared to contralateral normal side in equivocal cases",

It usually presents in the fifth to sixth decade. On CT, it is seen as a non-specific soft-tissue mass, as the fat content is usually not radiologically detectable. On MRI, because of the high content of myxoid cells (the most common type of liposarcoma), it is low signal on T1-weighted sequences and high signal on T2-weighted sequences. A lipoma would not be expected to enhance post-contrast. A large lymph node would be unlikely to reach the sizes described and additionally may be hyperintense to muscle on T1-weighted sequences. A soft-tissue fibroma would have a small hypointense nodule on all sequences. Lipoblastoma usually affects children less than 3 years of age",

      stem: "On a routine neonatal birth check, the paediatric registrar suspects an infant of having developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), and refers the him for a hip ultrasound. Which one of the following statements regarding hip ultrasound according to the Graf classification is correct?",
      options: [
        "A normal alpha angle is less than or equal to 60 degrees",
        "A normal beta angle is greater than 20 degrees",
        "The alpha angle is measured from the triangular labral fibrocartilage to the vertical cortex of the ilium",

        "The acetabular angle is measured from the acetabular roof to the vertical cortex of the ilium",
      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "The beta angle can help to determine the dysplasia subtype",
      explanation: "The Graf method for ultrasound classification system for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in infants combines both the alpha and beta angles. The alpha angle is formed by the acetabular roof to the vertical cortex of the ilium. The normal value is greater than or equal to 60 degrees. Less than 60 degrees suggests acetabular dysplasia. The beta angle is defined as the angle formed between the vertical cortex of the ilium and the triangular labral fibrocartilage (echogenic triangle). There is a great deal of variability in the beta angle and is not universally used The beta angle is necessary to determine the subtype of hip dysplasia. Acetabular angle is a radiographic assessment for dysplasia. It is formed by a horizontal line connecting both triradiate cartilages (Hilgenreiner line) and a second line which extends along the acetabular roofs",

      stem: "CT of the head of a young man for chronic headache showed erosion of the left frontal sinus. Post-contrast showed focal meningeal enhancement with mucosal enhancement of the right frontal sinus. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
      options: [
        "Mucocoele",

      response: "",
      answer: "Pott’s puffy tumour",
      explanation: "Pott’s puffy tumour is defined as a subperiosteal abscess of the frontal bone with frontal osteomyelitis. Frontal sinus infection can spread directly through the thin bone wall of this sinus or through the network of small veins that drain its mucosa. Today, this is a rare complication, given the widespread use of antibiotics. Trauma and frontal sinusitis are the most common causes of this condition. The bacteria causing Pott’s puffy tumour usually reflect the type of bacterial species responsible for community-acquired chronic sinusitis. The most common causal organisms are streptococci, staphylococci and anaerobic bacteria. Cultures frequently reveal polymicrobial involvement. The infection may spread as a thrombophlebitis from the frontal sinus through the diploic veins, involving the intracranial space with consequent epidural or subdural empyema, meningitis, brain abscess and venous sinus thrombosis",
