      answer: "Carotid-cavernous fistula",
      explanation: "Carotid-cavernous fistula (also described as caroticocavernous fistula) is an abnormal communication between the internal carotid artery (ICA) and the veins of the cavernous sinus. It is mostly due to trauma with laceration of the ICA within the cavernous sinus usually due to a skull base fracture or penetrating trauma. Ultrasound and MRI usually show arterial flow in the cavernous sinus and superior ophthalmic vein",

      answer: "Foci of calcification projected over the renal angles",
      explanation: "The main observations to be made on the plain abdominal radiograph relate primarily to the presence, amount and distribution of gas, which includes intraluminal gas, intramural gas, portal venous gas and free intraperitoneal gas. From observations of the intraluminal gas, it may sometimes be possible to make inferences regarding the presence of bowel wall thickening, free fluid and focal fluid collections. Dilatation with loss of the mosaic pattern and the development of rounded or elongated loops is more suggestive that an abnormality is present. On plain abdominal radiographs, intramural gas may be diffuse or localised and appears as linear or rounded radiolucencies. Extensive intramural gas can result in a mosaic pattern or bubbly appearance. Portal venous gas appears as branching, linear, radiolucent vessels that may extend from the region of the main portal vein towards the periphery of both hepatic lobes. On the supine view, large amounts of gas may give rise to the ‘football’ sign, where the gas outlines the whole of the peritoneal cavity, the undersurface of the diaphragm and the falciform ligament (the lacing of the football). In this view, even smaller amounts of free gas may be detected when both sides of the bowel wall are outlined (Rigler’s sign)",

      explanation: "Female urethral diverticula are thought to be caused by obstruction of Skene’s glands. Rarely, carcinoma (usually adenocarcinoma) or calculi can form within them. The gold standard imaging investigation is double-balloon catheter positive pressure urethrography; however, this is invasive and uses ionising radiation. The best first-line test is a pre- and post-void magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the urethra, as this avoids ionising radiation and does not involve invasive placement of catheters, and the patient can empty her bladder in private between scans. Positive pressure urethrography is reserved for cases where MRI is equivocal. The remaining options are inappropriate: transvaginal ultrasound may show a lesion but will not clearly demonstrate its relationship to the urethra; micturating cystourethrogram would have a high likelihood of a false negative, requires catheterisation, uses ionising radiation and requires the patient to void in the presence of the radiologist; urodynamics are a functional examination",

Barium swallow or endoscopy appearances are of giant ovoid flat ulcers >2 cm near the gastro-oesophageal junction or less commonly, smaller superficial ulcers. Giant ulcers can also be seen in HIV at the time of seroconversion. Caustic ingestion would usually have a different clinical history and tends to produce stricture of the oesophagus. Candida tends to involve the upper oesophagus, has linear plaques and is associated with abnormal motility. Behçet’s disease (a rare immune-mediated systemic vasculitis) produces aphthous ulcers.

      explanation: "Double aortic arch variants and right aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery and patent ductus arteriosus are the two most common types of vascular rings which encircle the mediastinal airways. Both these conditions cause leftward deviation of the trachea and indentation of the right tracheal wall visible on the chest X-ray together with a large posterior oesophageal impression visible on oesophagogram. Left aortic arch with aberrant right subclavian artery is the most common vascular anomaly of the aortic arch, but only in the extremely rare association with patent ductus arteriosus will it cause similar appearances. A less common vascular anomaly, which may cause a similar appearance of the trachea but does not cause any oesophageal indentation, is a common origin of innominate and left common carotid artery. Aberrant left pulmonary artery causes posterior tracheal indentation and anterior oesophageal impression",

      response: "",
      answer: "Punctate calcification is a feature of papillary carcinoma",
      explanation: "Thyroid calcifications may occur in both benign and malignant diseases. Thyroid calcifications can be classified as microcalcification, coarse calcification or peripheral calcification. Microcalcifications are found in 29%–59% of all primary thyroid carcinomas, most commonly in papillary thyroid carcinoma. Their occurrence has been described in follicular and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas as well as in benign conditions such as follicular adenoma and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. At US imaging, microcalcifications appear as punctate hyperechoic foci without acoustic shadowing. Coarse calcifications may coexist with microcalcifications in papillary cancers, and they are the most common type of calcification in medullary thyroid carcinomas. Inspissated colloid calcifications in benign thyroid lesions may mimic microcalcifications in thyroid malignancies, but the former can be distinguished from malignant calcifications by the observation of ring-down or reverberation artefact. Peripheral calcification is one of the patterns most commonly seen in a multinodular thyroid but may also be seen in malignancy. US features that should arouse suspicion about lymph node metastases include a rounded bulging shape, increased size, replaced fatty hilum, irregular margins, heterogeneous echotexture, calcifications, cystic area and vascularity throughout the lymph node instead of normal central hilar vessels at Doppler imaging",

      response: "",
      answer: "Rhabdomyosarcoma",
      explanation: "Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common mesenchymal tumour in children. Rhabdomyosarcoma is an aggressive, rapidly growing tumour and most often manifests with rapidly progressive proptosis or globe displacement. Orbital cellulitis is differential, but patients are afebrile and inflammatory markers are normal. On CT images, orbital rhabdomyosarcoma generally appears as an extraconal, irregular ovoid, well-circumscribed, homogeneous mass that is isoattenuated relative to muscle. Calcification is usually seen only in association with bone destruction. At MRI, they are isointense to muscle or brain with T1-weighted sequences and variably hyperintense to muscle and brain with T2-weighted pulse sequences. They enhance uniformly with contrast. Dermoid cyst is the most common orbital mass in children. Imaging features that suggest a dermoid include a cystic appearance, internal fat attenuation or signal intensity (T1 hyperintensity) and internal calcification, all of which are uncommon in rhabdomyosarcoma. On images, vascular malformations are often cystic and multiloculated with ill-defined borders. They frequently contain fluid–fluid levels because of haemorrhage into the cysts, whereas fluid– fluid levels are quite uncommon in rhabdomyosarcoma. Peripheral enhancement can be seen around cystic area, which is uncommon in rhabdomyosarcomas",

The Malgaigne, open book, straddle and bucket-handle fractures are all unstable, as the pelvic ring is interrupted in two places. The Malgaigne fracture is described in this case. The open book fracture implies fracture/ diastasis of both ischiopubic rami and sacroiliac joints, the straddle fracture involves both obturator rings and the bucket-handle fracture refers to an SI joint fracture with a contralateral ischiopubic ramus fracture. Patients with unstable fractures are at significant risk of pelvic organ injury and haemorrhage. Duverney fracture is an isolated fracture of the iliac wing and is a stable fracture",

Most of these disorders fall into one of three categories – lysosomal storage diseases, peroxisomal disorders and diseases caused by mitochondrial dysfunction – and each leukodystrophy has distinctive clinical, biochemical, pathological and radiological features. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is an inherited white matter disorder caused by gene mutation (ALD gene) resulting in abnormal formation of myelin. The childhood cerebral form (CCALD) is the most common and affects males aged between 4 and 10 years. Hyperpigmentation can occur as a result of adrenal insufficiency. The diagnostic clue is symmetric, peritrigonal white matter abnormality involving the splenium. Alexander disease characteristically involves the frontal white matter preferentially, and Canavan disease causes diffuse white matter abnormality",

It often causes abdominal pain, low-grade fever and an abdominal or pelvic mass/abscess, which can mimic a malignant mass as it can get quite large if left untreated. The earlier it is diagnosed and treated, the less likely the patient will require surgery. The cobra-shaped structure is an infected dilated tube.

      response: "",
      answer: "This patient carries an increased risk of developing pulmonary haemorrhage post-procedure",
      explanation: "Studies have identified lesion depth as being the most important risk factor for pulmonary haemorrhage, with an increased risk in lesions deeper than 2 cm. The incidence of pneumothorax is reported to be between 22% and 45%, of which 3.3–15% will require a chest drain. The risk of developing pneumothorax increases significantly if the lesion is not contiguous with the pleural surface. Studies have shown that the presence of chronic obstructive airway disease increases the necessity of chest drain insertion, although this does not necessarily hold for risk of pneumothorax. Although there are no definite absolute contraindications to CT-guided lung biopsy, there are, however, several relative contraindications. Patients should not undergo the procedure without adequate prebiopsy assessment or if they plan to fly within 6 weeks of the procedure. The risk is increased by abnormalities of lung function, respiratory failure (including mechanical ventilation), arterial and venous pulmonary hypertension and coagulation abnormalities. The balance of benefit against risk for the procedure should be assessed at a multidisciplinary meeting. Previous contralateral pneumonectomy precludes needle biopsy; however, if the lesion abuts the pleural surface and can be accessed with no needle traversing lung tissue, then the risk of pneumothorax is very low and may not, therefore, be considered as a contraindication. Patients should not undergo needle biopsy without further multidisciplinary team assessment if pulmonary function tests demonstrate an FEV1 of <35%",

      answer: "Constrictive pericarditis",
      explanation: "Constrictive pericarditis is a recognised complication of cardiac surgery, with recent evidence showing an incidence of 0.2%. The most common cause, however, would be idiopathic, thought to result from an occult viral pericarditis, with tuberculosis being the most common cause worldwide. Clinical symptoms attributed to both left- and right-sided heart failure are usually present. The hallmarks of pericardial constriction are pericardial thickening, pericardial calcification and abnormal diastolic ventricular function. Other findings associated with raised right-sided pressure such as dilatation of the superior vena cava and azygos vein help support the diagnosis. Constrictive pericarditis can be distinguished from restrictive cardiomyopathy on the basis of pericardial thickness measuring more than 4 mm in the presence of characteristic haemodynamic findings.

      answer: "Hepatoblastoma",
      explanation: "Hepatoblastoma is the most common primary hepatic tumour in children. Hepatoblastoma has been associated with several syndromes, including Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, Gardner syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, type 1A glycogen storage disease and trisomy 18. Heptoblastomas are most often hyperechoic relative to adjacent liver on US. A spoke-wheel appearance with areas of alternating echogenicity may be seen at antenatal imaging. CT shows a sharply circumscribed mass that is slightly hypoattenuating relative to the adjacent liver on unenhanced and contrast-enhanced images. Epithelial hepatoblastomas demonstrate a more homogeneous appearance, while mixed tumours are more heterogeneous in attenuation. Speckled or amorphous calcification is seen in more than 50% of lesions. The tumour enhances slightly, but less than adjacent liver. At MR imaging, epithelial hepatoblastomas are homogeneously slightly hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images relative to adjacent liver parenchyma. Mixed tumours demonstrate more heterogeneous signal intensity characteristics. Fibrotic septa are hypointense on both T1- and T2-weighted images and enhance after intravenous administration of gadolinium contrast material. Infantile haemangioendothelioma (IHE) is a vascular tumour and enhances much more than adjacent liver, while hepatoblastoma typically enhances much less than adjacent liver. Occasionally, the peripheral rim enhancement on arterial phase images seen in hepatoblastoma may suggest IHE, but IHE is distinguished by intense nodular or corrugated peripheral enhancement with centripetal fill-in on delayed phase images. Mesenchymal hamartoma of the liver (MHL) is a benign tumour that manifests in the same age group as hepatoblastoma. It can usually be distinguished from hepatoblastoma by normal serum AFP levels in MHL, predominantly cystic appearance and age at diagnosis >5 years (cf. hepatoblastoma generally diagnosed <5 years)",

It is to reduce anisotropy artefacts that result when the probe is not perpendicular to the structure being imaged. Similarly, reducing beam angle incidence would increase such artefacts. Reducing probe compression reduces posterior reverberation artefact. Placing the structure of interest within the central region of the probe and placing the focal zone at the region of interest reduce beam width artefact",

      answer: "Bilateral common peroneal nerve entrapment",
      explanation: "Common peroneal neuropathy (CPN) is the most common mononeuropathy in the lower extremity. In most cases, CPN neuropathy occurs in the knee region, whereas neuropathy of the superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) and deep peroneal nerve (DPN) occurs more distally in the leg, ankle or foot. The CPN is particularly prone to entrapment because it is fixed in position at the greater sciatic foramen (peroneal division) and around the fibular head. There are two common compression sites of the CPN. The nerve may be compressed as it crosses the fibular neck, owing to its superficial location, or as it travels under the origin of the peroneus longus muscle. Injury to the nerve at these locations may be the result of extrinsic compression, stretch injury or direct trauma. Extrinsic compression of the CPN can be the result of external compression by various agents such as short-leg cast, crush injury, surgery, tumour, osteochondroma, synovial cyst, intraneural and extraneural ganglia, varicosities, aberrant muscle, prolonged immobilisation (Saturday night palsy), prolonged squatting (strawberry pickers’ palsy) and extended lithotomy position due to childbirth or obstetric surgery will typically produce bilateral CPN entrapment. Diabetic patients are at an increased risk for entrapment of the CPN within the fibrous tunnel underneath the peroneus longus muscle. Patients with CPN often present with frequent tripping related to a foot drop. Pain may be present at the site of compression. Sensory disturbances include paraesthesia and anaesthesia along the lateral lower leg and dorsal foot. On physical examination, patients demonstrate foot drop, weak foot extension (anterior tibial muscle), weak foot eversion (peroneus longus and brevis muscles) and loss of sensation in the lower lateral two-thirds of the leg and the dorsum of the foot",

Common sites of involvement include proximal humerus, proximal tibia and proximal and distal femur. Appearances include widened and irregularly shaped physeal lucencies and metaphyseal flaring. There may be long bone deformation with lower limb bowing. Patients with rickets are at increased risk of Salter–Harris I fractures of the epiphyses that most commonly occur at the proximal femur (SCFE). While Blount’s disease is often associated with bow legged-ness in infants and children, it is an abnormality at the knee with an increase in the tibial metaphyseal angle. There are a few cases in the literature of SCFE in association with Blount’s disease.

      answer: "Ovarian fibroma",
      explanation: "Ovarian fibromas typically arise in postmenopausal women and are usually asymptomatic. Rarely, they can cause pressure-type symptoms if they get large enough, or tort causing pain. Ovarian fibromas are classically known to cause Meigs syndrome, which is the combination of ascites, pleural effusion and a benign ovarian tumour. The ascites and pleural effusion often resolve after tumour removal. They are also more common in Gorlin (basal cell naevus) syndrome, where they tend to occur at a younger age and are more likely to be bilateral. Owing to their highly fibrous component, they have a similar intensity to uterine fibroids, being low on T1 and T2-weighted sequences. On ultrasound, they are often hypoechoic with attenuation of the ultrasound beam as it passes through the lesion. About 1% can undergo malignant transformation to a fibrosarcoma. Krukenberg tumours result from ovarian metastases, classically from the stomach; however, colon, breast, lung, gynaecological tumours, sarcomas and melanoma can also spread to the ovary. These tumours would less likely be so low intensity on T1 and T2-weighted images and there may be a history of cancer. Ovarian mucinous cystadenomas tend to contain a jelly-like fluid, so are usually cystic on imaging, but can contain solid components. A dermoid cyst usually contains mixed elements including fat and would not usually cause ascites. Clear cell carcinoma is an aggressive ovarian lesion associated with endometriosis and a poor prognosis; these often have cystic and solid components",

It affects young to middle-aged adults and is more common in men. There is a strong association with cigarette smoking. Clinical features are variable, with symptoms usually being of gradual onset. Chest radiography typically demonstrates bilateral air-space opacity with either an ill-defined nodular or ground-glass pattern. An important discriminator from pulmonary oedema is the presence of perihilar lung changes in the absence of cardiomegaly, pulmonary venous hypertension and pleural effusions. Similarly, while sarcoidosis can mimic many lung conditions, the absence of lymphadenopathy is an important feature to note in alveolar proteinosis.

      answer: "Compressive lesions are common in the lumbar spine",
      explanation: "Vertebral haemangiomas are a hamartomatous lesion. Spinal haemangiomas are common and frequently multiple. The prevalence of haemangiomas seems to increase with age and is greatest after middle age, with a slight female predilection. Most haemangiomas are seen in the thoracic and lumbar spine. They are usually confined to the vertebral body, although they may occasionally extend into the posterior elements. Most spinal haemangiomas are asymptomatic. Occasionally, vertebral haemangiomas may increase in size and compress the spinal cord and nerve roots. Compressive vertebral haemangiomas can occur in patients of any age, with a peak prevalence in young adults and preferentially occur in the thoracic spine. CT shows the pattern as multiple dots (polka-dot appearance). At scintigraphy, the appearance of osseous haemangiomas ranges from photopenia to a moderate increase in radiotracer uptake. The presence of high signal intensity on T1-w and T2-weighted MR images is related to the amount of adipocytes or vessels and interstitial oedema, respectively. Fatty vertebral haemangiomas (high on T1-weighted MR) may represent inactive forms of this lesion, whereas low signal intensity at T1-weighted MR imaging may indicate a more active lesion with the potential to compress the spinal cord",

Breast tenderness is another sign, particularly in postmenopausal women. The fluid levels are caused by haemorrhage into the tumour cysts.

Endometrial hyperplasia and haemorrhagic corpus luteal cyst are related to ovulation, so do not occur in postmenopausal women.

      explanation: "Giant cell tumour of the spine occurs in the 2nd–4th decades of life, more frequently in females. Sacrum is affected in 90% of such cases. It is usually located in the upper sacrum and sacral wing. Extension to the iliac wing through the sacroiliac joint is possible. Lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine may be affected. It usually predominates in the vertebral body, with frequent involvement of the posterior arch. Extraosseous involvement of the soft tissues is common. Intervertebral disk invasion and extension into an adjacent vertebra are possible. In radiography, they appear as lytic lesion with cortical expansion. CT demonstrates lack of a sclerotic rim. Bone scintigraphy shows increased radiotracer uptake. The tumour usually has low-to-intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted MR images. Areas of high signal intensity suggest haemorrhage. More specifically, they have low to intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted images, caused by haemosiderin and high collagen content. Enhancement reflects its vascular supply. Cystic areas, haemorrhage, fluid–fluid levels and a peripheral low-signal-intensity pseudocapsule may also be seen. ABC occurs between 5 and 20 years but can manifest at any age. There may be a slight female predilection. Thoracic spine is most commonly affected. Spinal involvement is typically in the posterior elements, although extension into the vertebral body is common. Spinal ABC may extend into the adjacent vertebrae or intervertebral disk, ribs and the paravertebral soft tissue. CT and MR imaging typically show a well-defined lesion with internal septation. Fluid–fluid level is better seen on MRI. The predominant bone scintigraphic pattern is moderate to intense radiotracer accumulation at the periphery with little activity at its centre ('doughnut sign'). Post-contrast images show intense enhancement of the septa. Solid components suggest secondary ABC",

Leiomyoma tends to be sharply demarcated as opposed to ill-defined and tends to have low-intensity T1 and T2 signals, although multiple signal characteristics are seen. It would be unusual for leiomyomas to have linear bands extending from the endometrium; this is more commonly seen in adenomyosis. Leiomyoma and leiomyosarcomas cannot be differentiated accurately on imaging; secondary features of lymphadenopathy or metastasis can help raise the suspicion of leiomyosarcoma. Endometrial carcinoma usually presents in an older age group and tends to present with symptoms of irregular bleeding, which is why it is often diagnosed at an early stage.

In advanced disease, abnormalities of the substantia nigra, including volume loss, decreased T2 signal reflecting iron deposition and blurring of the margins, can be seen. However, the primary role of MRI is to exclude structural abnormalities that potentially mimic Parkinson’s disease (e.g., NPH – normal pressure hydrocephalous, intracranial mass and bilateral subdural haematomas). FDG PET images are most often normal and show preserved metabolism in the putamen and globus pallidus. This is a defining feature of Parkinson’s disease and allows differentiation from both PSP (progressive supranuclear palsy) and MSA (multisystem atrophy, Shy–Drager syndrome), which commonly demonstrate reduced basal ganglia FDG activity. In patients with MSA–Parkinson’s type, abnormalities are confined to the putamen and include atrophy, symmetric hypointensity on T2 and T2*-weighted images and ‘slitlike’ marginal T2 hyperintensity. Putaminal atrophy appears to help discriminate MSA from Parkinson’s disease, whereas T2 hypointensity is a non-specific sign that can be seen in PSP, Wilson’s disease, neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation and other acquired conditions. Patients with PSP exhibit atrophy of the midbrain and tegmentum, manifesting as third ventricular dilatation, reduced midbrain AP diameter or flattening of the superior midbrain. Reduced midbrain AP diameter at the level of the superior colliculi on axial images gives rise to the Mickey Mouse sign. Midbrain atrophy with relative preservation of pons produces the hummingbird sign or penguin sign. Additional findings include superior cerebellar peduncle atrophy and increased FLAIR signal, both of which have reasonably high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing PSP from Parkinson’s disease and MSA",

A mature abscess has a low-signal-intensity capsule on T2-weighted images. However, the presence of a ring-enhancing lesion in the brain is not diagnostic of abscess and must be distinguished from a necrotic neoplasm and other cystic lesions. Data from recent studies suggest that DWI is more sensitive than conventional MRI in distinguishing brain abscesses and cystic tumours. Pus in brain abscesses is strongly hyperintense on trace DWI and has a reduced ADC. On the contrary, most necrotic or cystic brain tumours have intermediate signal intensity on DWI and elevated ADC values",

      explanation: "Cervical carcinoma tends to be of higher signal on T2 than the surrounding cervical stroma and, in the above case, there is also disruption of the cervical stromal fibrous ring, increasing the likelihood of microscopic parametrial invasion. In this case, the cervical tumour is causing a malignant cervical stenosis and haematometra (high T1 signal is consistent with haemorrhage; tumour is usually intermediate signal/hypointense, similar to myometrium on T1 imaging). After radiotherapy to the cervix, cervical stenosis with haematometra can occur; however, post radiotherapy, the cervix becomes low signal because of fibrosis. Ovaries usually lie to either side of the midline, and it would be unusual for a cervical carcinoma metastasis of the ovary to have a high T1 signal. Imperforate hymen is congenital and is normally picked up either neonatally or at the time of menarche, if the latter commonly presents with haematometrocolpos; it would be inconsistent with a cervical cancer history, as this tumour is not seen in patients who are virgo intacta",

Evidence already exists that EUS is superior to cross-sectional imaging in the local staging (for assessment of both the primary tumour and local nodes) of oesophageal, pancreatic and rectal cancer.

Haemorrhagic ovarian cysts are a common cause of pelvic pain in adolescent girls and appear as an echogenic mass in relation to the ovary. Acute appendicitis is likely to occur as a blind-ending tubular structure. This may appear like a ‘target lesion’ in cross section and there may be fluid/collection adjacent to it. An acute appendix should be clearly distinct from the right ovary. Ovarian dermoids are usually predominantly fat filled and therefore echogenic on ultrasound, but these tend to be a painless, incidental finding. Ovarian torsion can certainly produce an echogenic mass within the right pelvis, but this is less common than haemorrhagic cysts and would not appear distinct from the ovary.

      explanation: "Fibroids (leiomyomas) are benign tumours made of smooth muscle. Afro-Caribbean women are more prone than Caucasian women to developing fibroids. Fibroids can outgrow their blood supply and undergo degeneration causing them to look very different on MRI depending on the type of degeneration that they undergo. Typically, a non-degenerated fibroid is a well-defined low-intensity lesion on T1 and T2-weighted images, and enhances post contrast injection. Hyaline degeneration is caused by necrotic central change and increasing collagen content; this causes variable signal on T1-weighted images but low signal on T2-weighted images. With calcific degeneration, the fibroid has similar signal characteristics on T1 and T2 to typical non-degenerative fibroids. Cystic degeneration can produce areas of fluid signal within the fibroid, which does not enhance. Myxoid degeneration results in a very high T2 signal with a little enhancement. Red degeneration is a very rare type of degeneration; it typically causes severe pain and can cause a fever. It is the result of thrombosis of the vessels surrounding the fibroid leading to the high T1 and low T2 signal rim, and it usually occurs in pregnancy",

      response: "",
      answer: "Slow flow mimics sinus thrombosis on contrast-enhanced MRV",
      explanation: "The classic finding on unenhanced CT is a hyperattenuating thrombus in the occluded sinus (delta sign). However, this is seen in only 25% cases. Increased attenuation in the venous sinuses may also be seen in patients with dehydration, an elevated haematocrit level, or a subjacent subarachnoid or subdural haemorrhage. On contrast-enhanced CT/MRI, the empty delta sign is seen, a central intraluminal filling defect that represents a thrombus surrounded by contrast-enhanced dural collateral venous channels and cavernous spaces within the dural envelope. Unenhanced MRI is more sensitive for the detection of venous thrombi than is unenhanced CT. The absence of a flow void and the presence of altered signal in the sinus is a primary finding. Slow or turbulent flow also may cause a signal intensity alteration in the sinus. The signal intensity of venous thrombi on T1- and T2-weighted MR images varies according to the interval between thrombus formation and the time of imaging. Time-of-flight (TOF) MR venography is the method most commonly used for diagnosis. Contrast-enhanced MRV utilises the paramagnetic effect of intravenous gadolinium to shorten T1 relaxation time and provide positive intravascular contrast enhancement. Small-vessel visualisation is improved at contrast-enhanced MRV. Depiction of the dural sinuses is also superior with contrast-enhanced MR venography because of a decrease in the effects of turbulent/slow flow on vessel contrast. An irregular appearance of the sinus with multiple intrasinus channels and dural collateral vessels on MRV is characteristic of incomplete recanalisation. Complete recanalisation occurs more often in superior sagittal and straight sinus thrombosis than transverse and sigmoid sinuses after anticoagulation therapy",

Haemorrhage may occur with both types of oedema. In contrast with arterial ischaemic states, many parenchymal abnormalities secondary to venous occlusion are reversible. Although parenchymal changes may occur in areas of the brain that are directly drained by the occluded venous sinus, in some patients, the parenchymal changes may not closely correlate with the location of venous occlusion.

Other more likely differentials would include bronchogenic cyst and pericardial cyst, and these are often very difficult to differentiate even on computed tomography (CT) and MRI. Duplication cysts occur most commonly in relation to the small bowel, in particular the ileum; the oesophagus is, however, the second most common location. When identified, the ‘muscular rim sign’ on ultrasound is diagnostic. This results from an alternating echogenic inner mucosal lining and a hypoechoic outer rim signal from the mucosal lining",

      answer: "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis",
      explanation: "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a monophasic autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that typically follows a febrile infection or vaccination. The disorder is immunologically mediated because of an autoimmune reaction to myelin. Peak incidence is in children aged 3–10 years. Typically, ADEM manifests as multifocal lesions mimicking MS. However, clinical and radiologic criteria distinguish between ADEM and MS. ADEM typically meets at least two of the three following criteria: (a) They have clinical symptoms atypical of MS, e.g., altered consciousness, hypersomnia, seizures, cognitive impairment, hemiplegia, quadriparesis, aphasia or bilateral optic neuritis. (b) They have absence of oligoclonal bands in CSF. (c) They have grey matter involvement (basal ganglia or cortical lesions). Imaging features, such as the number of T2 hyperintense lesions and the presence of gadolinium enhancement, oedema and periventricular or brainstem lesions, cannot be used to reliably differentiate between ADEM and MS. Corpus callosal involvement is less frequent in patients with ADEM than in those with MS. Cerebrospinal fluid findings, especially the presence or absence of oligoclonal bands, remain important in the differentiation of patients with MS from those with ADEM. The best criterion is the course of the disease, with a good outcome in 57%–81% of patients with ADEM, with no new lesions and partial or complete recovery of existing lesions on follow-up MR images",

On MRI, granulomatous prostatitis may appear as a discrete mass with markedly abnormal T2 signal, DWI and ADC map. Furthermore, there may be associated infiltration of the periprostatic fat by inflammation, thus mimicking extraprostatic tumour extension. Currently, histopathologic analysis is regarded as the only means of definitively establishing the diagnosis and thereby excluding the presence of tumour; however, a suggestive history, such as prior BCG therapy, may be useful in prompting consideration of the diagnosis.

They are typically heterogeneous and are usually iso- to hyperdense on CT, with calcifications in 70%. On MRI, they may appear Chapter 14 TEST PAPER 7: ANSWERS 421 iso- to hyperintense to grey matter on FLAIR and T2-weighted images. The solid component usually has avid heterogeneous enhancement with minimal oedema. Necrosis and haemorrhage are common and are seen as restriction on DWI. On MR images, choroid plexus papillomas appear as isointense to hypointense intraventricular masses compared with normal brain parenchyma. Flow voids, consistent with flowing blood, are common. CT show intense enhancement. Hydrocephalus is very common. Gangliogliomas develop in the temporal lobe and are commonly associated with refractory seizures, partial complex type. Calcification is seen in 30%. Peripherally located gangliogliomas may cause scalloped pressure erosion of the calvaria. At MRI, a well-defined cystic mass with a solid mural nodule is typically seen; however, a solid mass with non-specific low-to-intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal on T2-weighted images is also not uncommon. Enhancement is variable, ranging from non-enhancing to ring like to intense homogeneity. There is usually little associated mass effect or oedema",

Tumours may appear as a single enhancing bladder mass or as diffuse or focal wall thickening. Intradiverticular squamous tumours are soft-tissue masses, sometimes with surface calcification. In contrast to urothelial carcinoma, squamous carcinoma is sessile rather than papillary, and pure intraluminal growth is not seen. Bladder wall thickening and calcification, from chronic inflammation or infection with Bilharzia, may coexist and complicate the diagnosis",

      stem: "A restrained driver of a car involved in a high-speed road traffic accident is brought to the emergency department. He is hypovolaemic, tachycardic and has a very tender abdomen. After stabilisation, an urgent intravenous contrast-enhanced CT scan is performed which show features of significant mesenteric injury and the patient is immediately taken to theatre. Which CT sign is not specific for significant mesenteric injury?",
      options: [
        "Mesenteric contrast extravasation",
        "Mesenteric fat infiltration",
        "Mesenteric vascular beading",
        "Termination of mesenteric vessels",
        "Bowel ischaemia",
      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Mesenteric fat infiltration",
      explanation: "Significant mesenteric injury requires urgent vascular surgical treatment and, if missed, can lead to life-threatening bowel ischaemia. The most specific CT feature of significant mesenteric injury is mesenteric contrast extravasation, which is almost 100% sensitive. Other highly specific features are vascular beading (irregularity of mesenteric vessels) and termination of mesenteric vessels, which, when seen, are an indication for vascular surgery. Lack of bowel wall enhancement is highly suggestive of segmental bowel ischaemia secondary to significant vascular injury. Mesenteric fat infiltration is a common but very non-specific feature of abdominal trauma. It may be present in bowel wall laceration, contusion or incomplete bowel wall tear as well as in significant bowel and mesenteric injuries",
