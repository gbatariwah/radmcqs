      answer: "Cystic fibrosis (CF)",
      explanation: "The classic diagnostic triad in patients with cystic fibrosis includes an abnormal sweat chloride test result and manifestations of pulmonary and pancreatic disease. Upper lobe predominance is seen in many but not all cases; a diffuse distribution is also common. Normal to increased lung volumes are typical in CF and indicate air trapping and small airways disease. CT images show extensive cystic and cylindrical bronchiectasis and bronchial wall and peribronchial interstitial thickening. Findings are typically more extensive in patients with bronchiectasis due to cystic fibrosis than in patients with bronchiectasis due to other causes. Nodular opacities throughout the lungs correlate with areas of mucoid bronchial or bronchiolar impaction. Tree-in-bud nodules indicate the diffuse bronchiolitis that typically occurs in cystic fibrosis. In addition, a mosaic pattern of attenuation secondary to air trapping due to obstructed bronchi and bronchioles is commonly seen",

      response: "",
      answer: "They are rich in glycogen",
      explanation: "Serous cystadenomas are benign cystic neoplasms of the pancreas that occur frequently in older women (median age 65 years). Serous cystadenomas are composed of numerous small cysts that are conjoined in a honeycomb-like formation. The size of these cysts ranges from 0.1 to 2.0 cm but typically is less than 1 cm. The cysts are lined by glycogen-rich epithelium and separated by fibrous septa that radiate from a central scar, which may be calcified. This formation has led to the use of the more descriptive term microcystic pancreatic lesion. Serous cystadenomas are usually discovered incidentally at imaging; however, those that are large may cause symptoms such as abdominal pain or, more rarely, jaundice. Progressive enlargement of serous cystadenomas – especially those with a size of 4 cm or more at initial manifestation may be seen at serial follow-up imaging examinations performed over a period of months or years. Multiple serous cystadenomas may occur in von Hippel–Lindau disease. At MR imaging, a serous cystadenoma appears as a cluster of small cysts within the pancreas, with no visible communication between the cysts and the pancreatic duct. The cysts show signal intensity of simple fluid on T2-weighted images, and the thin fibrous septa between them enhance on delayed contrast-enhanced MR images",

      answer: "Retinoblastoma",
      explanation: "Retinoblastoma is the most common tumour of the globe in children. It is seen in children less than 3 years, presenting with leukocoria; 75% are unilateral and unifocal, 25% are bilateral or unilateral multifocal. When seen bilaterally in conjunction with pineoblastoma, it is called trilateral retinoblastoma. CT is preferred and shows clumped or punctate calcification (95%) in the posterior aspect of the eye, extending into the vitreous humor with minimal enhancement. Absence of calcification makes retinoblastoma unlikely. On MRI, retinoblastomas are hyperintense on T1-weighted and hypointense on T2-weighted images, possibly due to calcification or paramagnetic tumour protein. MRI is better at depicting tumour extension along optic nerves and intracranially. CT is better at showing bone destruction including expansion of the optic canal",

      answer: "Fibular stress fractures affect the proximal end",
      explanation: "The tibia is the most commonly involved bone, accounting for up to almost half of stress fractures reported in some series. Two types of tibial stress fractures have been described – transverse and longitudinal. Transverse fractures are more common and can occur on the compression side (posterior) or tension side (anterior). Posterior transverse fractures of the tibial shaft are most commonly seen in long-distance runners. Tension stress transverse fractures of the anterior tibial shaft occur more commonly in jumpers and have a higher propensity for non-union and progression to an acute complete fracture. The most common site of fibular stress fracture in runners is the lower fibula, just proximal to the tibiotalar syndesmosis. Femoral neck stress fractures are associated with the classic ‘female athlete triad’ of amenorrhoea, osteoporosis and eating disorders. Femoral neck stress fractures are often classified as tension side (superolateral or transverse) or compression side (inferolateral), with the contention that tension side fractures are associated with poorer prognosis and are potentially unstable. The femoral shaft is particularly susceptible to repetitive stresses on the medial compression side of the femur at the junction of the proximal and middle thirds. Fractures of the sacrum have predominantly been described in long-distance runners, particularly women, but have also been reported in hockey players. Sacral stress fractures are also associated with the female athlete triad",

        "They may be extrapancreatic in location",
      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "They have an epithelial lining",
      explanation: "Overall, pseudocysts are the most common cystic lesions of the pancreas. These lesions occur in the setting of pancreatitis, resulting from haemorrhagic fat necrosis and encapsulation of pancreatic secretions by granulation tissue and a fibrous capsule. The MR imaging appearance of pseudocysts may evolve over time; they are often irregularly marginated early in their formation but become well circumscribed, with a thickened enhancing wall, over a period of several weeks. Blood products and necrotic or proteinaceous debris are commonly present and produce intrinsically increased T1 signal intensity. The thickened and enhancing cyst wall seen on images corresponds to a thick rim of granulation tissue and fibrosis that is uniformly seen at histologic analysis. Other changes of acute or chronic pancreatitis are frequently seen in association with pseudocysts, and MR imaging may be the imaging modality of choice for depicting the features of parenchymal pancreatic disease. MR imaging has proved superior to CT for demonstrating internal complexity in pseudocysts. Furthermore, the signal intensity increase in tissues surrounding a complicated pseudocyst on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images correlates with the degree of inflammation present. However, in patients with a pseudocyst, the cause of inflammation is more likely to be chemical irritation than infection, and it may be impossible to differentiate between an infectious process and other possible causes on the basis of imaging features alone. Clinical manifestations may be similarly unhelpful, since the symptoms of chemical irritation may be identical to those of sepsis. Moreover, pancreatic pseudocysts may dissect along abdominopelvic fascial planes to sites remote from the pancreas (e.g., liver, pleura or mediastinum). Fistulation may occur between a pseudocyst and one or more vascular structures",

      answer: "Increased abdominal circumference",
      explanation: "The hallmarks of the diagnosis, in the first trimester as well as later in pregnancy, are the presence of the stomach, bowel or liver in the chest, shift of the mediastinum and displacement of the heart to the contralateral side. Increase in abdominal circumference is not a feature; the contrary can however be observed and can be a clue. In 50% of affected foetuses, there are associated chromosomal abnormalities or other malformation. The hernia results from abnormal formation or fusion of the pleuroperitoneal membranes with the septum transversum, and it is surgically correctable. Neonatal death results from pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension",

      explanation: "Morton neuromas are masses composed of interdigital perineural fibrosis and nerve degeneration. Morton neuroma occurs between the metatarsal heads, most commonly between the third and fourth toes. Morton neuroma is more common in women, and high-heeled shoes have been implicated as a causative factor. Pain at the metatarsal head, often radiating to the toes, is characteristic. The MRI appearance is that of a tear-drop-shaped soft-tissue mass between the metatarsal heads, projecting inferiorly into the plantar subcutaneous fat and located plantar to the intermetatarsal ligament. The mass is typically intermediate in signal intensity on T1-weighted images. It is iso- or hypointense relative to fat on T2-weighted images, resulting in poor lesion conspicuity. The use of gadopentetate dimeglumine is helpful because intense enhancement typically occurs on fat-suppressed T1-weighted images, increasing the conspicuity of the lesion",

      answer: "Malignant melanoma of the choroid",
      explanation: "Primary orbital melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults. MR imaging is superior to CT in the evaluation of choroidal melanomas, as melanin has intrinsic T1 and T2 shortening effects, thereby manifesting with increased T1 signal intensity and decreased T2 signal intensity. CT is non-specific, often demonstrating a hyperattenuating choroidal mass. MR imaging is also valuable for identifying other features, such as large tumour size, extraocular extension and ciliary body infiltration, all of which also portend a poorer prognosis. In addition, MR imaging is superior to CT for identifying retinal detachment and extrascleral spread. Notably, approximately 20% of melanomas are amelanotic, thereby lacking characteristic T1 and T2 shortening effects on MR images. In addition, MR signal characteristics may not always allow melanoma to be reliably distinguished from ocular metastases",

      explanation: "Round pneumonia usually occurs in children under the age of 8 years. It is most commonly seen with bacterial pneumonia (pneumococcus). The mass has an alarming appearance on CXR; however, further investigation is only warranted if there is concern regarding the diagnosis. A CXR as soon as 48 hours later often shows dissipation of the mass into more typical consolidation, or complete resolution following antibiotic treatment. It is most common in the superior segment of the lower lobes. It is important to make the diagnosis to avoid unnecessary CT. Bronchogenic cyst is often an incidental finding and often has a compressive effect unlike round pneumonia. Thoracic neuroblastoma may be an incidental finding, but the clinical history given is more in keeping with an infective process. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is usually diagnosed antenatally or in the neonatal period.

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours (5%–17%) also occur. Combined lesions occur, but neuroendocrine tumours and cystic lesions only rarely exist together. The reported prevalence of pancreatic involvement in VHL disease varies from 0% in some family groups to 77% in others. Pancreatic cysts are extremely rare in the general population; therefore, the presence of a single cyst in an individual undergoing VHL disease screening because of a family history makes it highly likely that the person has VHL disease. In general, cystic pancreatic lesions in VHL disease are asymptomatic or associated with only mild symptoms. As a result, they are typically detected during screening examinations and may therefore facilitate the identification of gene carriers.

In CF, abnormal function of sweat glands result in higher concentrations of sodium chloride in the sweat; >40 mmol/L is suspicious and >60 mmol/L is diagnostic of CF. Spirometry shows an obstructive pattern with reduced FVC and increased lung volumes. Chest X-ray shows hyperinflation, bronchial dilatation, bronchiectasis and its associated signs, cystic spaces, increases interstitial and linear/reticular opacities, and increased AP dimension on lateral chest X-ray. CF is not routinely associated with dextrocardia.

Pleural effusion is recognised. COP is less common and occurs in association with NSIP.

Some omental infarcts are related to a combination of the reduced arterial and venous blood flow that occurs in hypercoagulable states, congestive heart failure and vasculitis. Secondary omental infarction may occur after a traumatic injury as a result of surgical trauma or inflammation of the omentum. Often, the site of secondary infarction is near the surgical site rather than in the right lower quadrant, the typical location of primary omental infarction. Patients with omental infarction usually present with subacute onset of pain in the right lower quadrant, often with a slightly elevated white blood cell count. Other gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting, nausea and fever are absent. Establishing a preoperative diagnosis of omental infarction is difficult because it often mimics acute appendicitis or cholecystitis. In most cases, the radiologist makes the diagnosis after cross-sectional imaging has been performed. Omental infarction demonstrates a variety of imaging appearances at CT. Classically; it appears as a fatty, large (>5 cm) encapsulated mass, with soft-tissue stranding adjacent to the ascending colon.

      explanation: "The imaging appearance of optic nerve gliomas is characteristic, such that biopsy is rarely performed. MR imaging is the modality of choice, particularly for assessing involvement of the orbital apex, optic chiasm, hypothalamus and other intracranial structures. The lesions are typically isointense on T1-weighted images and isointense to hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Enhancement is variable, and cystic spaces may be seen. Calcifications are rare. A rim of T2 hyperintensity is often observed at the tumour periphery, a finding that may mimic an expanded subarachnoid space. However, this finding corresponds histopathologically to leptomeningeal infiltration and proliferation (so-called arachnoidal gliomatosis). The appearance of optic nerve gliomas is different in patients with and without NF1. In patients with NF1, the optic nerve often appears tortuous, kinked or buckled and diffusely enlarged. In patients without NF1, gliomas tend to be fusiform. Isolated chiasmal gliomas are more likely in the absence of neurofibromatosis, and chiasmal involvement is also more common in patients who do not have neurofibromatosis",

The pattern of venous drainage, either anterior into the ophthalmic veins or posterior into the petrosal sinuses, often dictates the clinical findings and radiographic appearance. Anterior drainage typically leads to the most dramatic ocular findings and enlargement of the superior orbital vein, the latter often detectable with CT or MRI. However, superior orbital vein enlargement is not specific to CCF. Additional radiographic findings with variable prevalence include lateral bulging of the cavernous sinus wall and enlargement of extraocular muscles on CT or MRI, and abnormal cavernous sinus flow voids on MRI. Direct visualisation of flow-related hyperintensity on the source images of three-dimensional time-of-flight MRA can be extremely helpful in CCF detection, with 83% sensitivity and 100% specificity, far superior to standard MRI",

      answer: "Haemangioma",
      explanation: "Although not true neoplasms, cavernous malformations are the most common benign orbital mass in adults. Although these masses are commonly referred to as cavernous haemangiomas, many pathologists prefer the term cavernous malformation. On CT images, cavernous malformations are typically well circumscribed, homogeneous and ovoid. The majority occur at the lateral aspect of the intraconal space. Conal and extraconal cavernous malformations are rare. Phleboliths are virtually never seen. Cavernous malformations tend to displace and surround adjacent structures, such as extraconal muscles and the optic nerve, rather than cause direct invasion. Osseous remodelling may be present, although bone erosion is rare. At MRI performed with T1-weighted sequences, cavernous malformations are isointense relative to muscle; the lesions appear uniformly hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with no flow voids. Internal septations may be identified on T2-weighted images. At multiphase CT, enhancement of cavernous malformations is poor on early arterial phase images, owing to the scant arterial supply. Delayed venous phase images demonstrate progressive filling of the mass from periphery to centre, with complete filling within 30 minutes. This enhancement pattern may permit differentiation of cavernous malformations from other vascular lesions with rich arterial supply, such as capillary haemangioma (a paediatric diagnosis), haemangiopericytoma and arteriovenous malformations. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft-tissue malignancy of childhood and most common primary orbital malignancy. CT shows moderately well-defined to ill-defined margins, irregular shape and mild–moderate contrast enhancement. Adjacent bony destruction occurs in 40%.

      explanation: "Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) affects women of reproductive age and can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy and chronic pelvic pain. In acute cases when dilated fallopian tubes are detected, it is extremely important to be able to differentiate tubal torsion from a pyosalpinx. A tubal torsion and a hematosalpinx may have a similar appearance to that of a fluid-filled tube on T2-weighted and STIR images; on T1-weighted images, however, a fluid-filled tube has low signal intensity. Layering is common with haemorrhagic lesions, and tubal torsion may have a comma-shaped appearance. A pyosalpinx may have a similar appearance to that of a hydrosalpinx, but a hydrosalpinx usually has thinner walls. An abscess usually has low T1-weighted and high T2-weighted signal, but there can be a large variation in the signal intensity on T1-weighted and heterogeneity on T2-weighted images. Thick, irregular walls are typical of abscesses. The T1 signal of pyosalpinx/TO abscess varies according to haemorrhagic/proteinaceous content. On post-contrast T1-weighted images, pyosalpinx shows wall enhancement. Enhancement of the surrounding inflamed fat can also be evident. Inflammatory fat stranding is also seen on fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences",

      explanation: "Although RDS is seen in association with maternal diabetes and caesarean section, hyperexpansion is not a feature of RDS. Transient tachypnoea of the newborn appears soon after birth (<4 hours) and has been identified as occurring with caesarean birth and infant sedation. Longer labour intervals, macrosomia of the foetus, and maternal asthma have also been associated. It may be accompanied by chest retractions, by expiratory grunting, or by cyanosis (which can be relieved with minimal oxygen). Recovery is usually complete within 3 days. The lungs are usually affected diffusely and symmetrically, and the condition is commonly accompanied by small pleural effusions. The clinical course of transient tachypnoea is relatively benign when compared with the severity suggested by chest films. Radiographic resolution by the second or third day characterises this entity and differentiates it from other possible disorders; if radiographic resolution is not complete by the third day or if respiratory symptoms persist longer than 5 days, an alternative diagnosis should be sought. Findings of transient tachypnoea of the newborn on chest radiographs may include mild, symmetrical lung overaeration, prominent perihilar interstitial markings and small pleural effusions. The radiographic appearance at times can mimic the diffuse, granular appearance of hyaline membrane disease but without pulmonary underaeration. Neonates with transient tachypnoea are usually delivered at term. Radiographic lung changes may also resemble the coarse, interstitial pattern seen with other causes of pulmonary oedema or the irregular pattern of lung opacification seen in meconium aspiration syndrome",

In 1935, Whipple and Frantz described the classic clinical triad of insulinomas: symptoms of hypoglycaemia, low blood glucose and relief of symptoms with administration of glucose. Hypoglycaemia typically manifests during fasting or after exercise, and patients often self-medicate by eating frequent small meals.

Endometriomas tend to have higher T1 and lower T2 signal than haemorrhagic cysts, due to higher protein content and viscosity (described as T2 shading). Multifocal lesions and bilateral lesions also favour endometriosis.

Usually, mucocoeles are seen as an isodense or mildly hyperdense sinus opacity in relation to the cerebral tissue, but in cases of acute infection it may appear as a more dense and peripherally enhanced image. The neighbouring bone structure is remodelled with areas of thickening, expansion and erosion. Additionally, in the areas of greater fragility, one may observe herniation into adjacent structures, displacing structures rather than invading them. Invasion would suggest malignancy. The radiological appearance at MRI varies with the time of evolution of the disease. Initially, the contents will be predominantly aqueous, so the corresponding image will be hypointense on T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences.

      answer: "Ureteric endometriosis is mostly intrinsic",
      explanation: "Deep pelvic endometriosis is defined as subperitoneal invasion by endometriotic lesions that exceeds 5 mm in depth. Involvement of anatomic structures such as the uterosacral ligaments or the vaginal or rectal wall should be suspected when these structures have a hypointense thickened or nodular appearance on T2-weighted images. Intermingled high T2 signal would be secondary to ectopic endometrial glands. On T1-weighted or fat-suppressed T1-weighted MR images, these foci may have either high or low signal intensity, depending on the presence or absence of bloody content. Some endometriomas may show restricted diffusion on DWI, probably due to intracystic blood clots. Enhancement may or may not occur post-contrast, depending on the proportions of inflammatory reaction, glandular tissue and fibrosis. Bladder endometriosis should be considered in anyone who presents with urinary tract symptoms after having undergone hysterectomy or other gynaecologic surgical procedure. Because vesical endometriosis seldom invades the mucosa, MR imaging may show abnormalities although cystoscopy is normal. As with bladder involvement, extrinsic endometriosis is the most common form of ureteral involvement. On MR imaging, ureteral endometriosis usually appears as irregular hypointense nodules on T2-weighted images. Deep retroperitoneal endometriotic lesions of the posterior compartment involve the rectovaginal pouch, retrocervical area, uterosacral ligaments, posterior vaginal fornix, rectovaginal septum and rectum. Obliteration of the pouch of Douglas occurs when retrocervical lesions extend to the anterior rectal wall",

The small intestine is most commonly involved, with the order from most to least common being the ileum, jejunum and duodenum. Most duplication cysts manifest during the first year of life, although some occasionally manifest in older patients. Children can present with a variety of symptoms including abdominal distention, vomiting, bleeding, a palpable abdominal mass and rarely urinary frequency and hesitancy. Complications include perforation, intussusception, bowel obstruction from adjacent pressure or mass effect, volvulus and associated malignancy. Malignant lesions arising from duplication cysts are rare, particularly in children",

      explanation: "Intrauterine filling defects seen at HSG may be caused by air bubbles in the contrast material injection, intrauterine adhesions, submucosal leiomyomas, endometrial polyps or blood clots. Intrauterine adhesions, or synechiae, may be the result of previous pregnancy, dilation and curettage, surgery or infection. They appear as irregular linear filling defects at HSG; the endometrial cavity may appear distorted or may not expand as expected with contrast. Even subcentimetric endometrial polyps and submucosal leiomyomas may interfere with embryo transfer and implantation. Submucosal leiomyomas distort the normal-appearing endometrium. Uterine contour irregularities observed at HSG can be due to adenomyosis, uterine leiomyomas and Müllerian duct anomalies. Submucosal leiomyoma located near the uterine cornua may obstruct the ipsilateral fallopian tube. Cervical abnormalities include cervical factor infertility, an inadequate quality or volume of cervical mucus, a condition that accounts for approximately 10% of cases of female infertility, and cervical stenosis",

However, the presence of bony erosions of the sinonasal wall is very suspect of the diagnosis of a granulomatous disease. Bone erosion commonly affects the lamina papyracea (orbital wall), inter sino-nasal wall and nasal septum. Bone destruction usually involves the nasal septum and then extends to the sinonasal wall, destroying the turbinates. Differential diagnoses including traumatic lesions (accidental, iatrogenic) or toxic lesions (cocaine abuse, chromium salts) should be considered. Isolated septal perforation should suggest the diagnosis of GP.

      answer: "ACL",
      explanation: "The pivot shift injury is a non-contact injury commonly seen in skiers or US football players. The resulting bone contusion (pivot shift oedema) pattern involves the posterior aspect of the lateral tibial plateau and the midportion of the lateral femoral condyle. The exact location of the lateral femoral condyle injury depends on the degree of flexion of the knee at injury. Another recently described bone contusion pattern associated with the pivot shift injury is oedema within the posterior lip of the medial tibial plateau. Pivot shift oedema is typically associated with ACL tear, most commonly mid-substance. Dashboard oedema is seen at the anterior aspect of the tibia and, occasionally, at the posterior surface of the patella. The associated soft-tissue injuries include disruption of the PCL (most commonly mid-substance) posterior joint capsule. Hyperextension of the knee can result in kissing contusion involving the anterior aspect of the tibial plateau and the anterior aspect of the femoral condyle. ACL, PCL and meniscal injury can be associated depending on the force. The classic bone contusion pattern seen after lateral patellar dislocation includes involvement of the anterolateral aspect of the lateral femoral condyle and the inferomedial aspect of the patella. This is associated with tear of MPFL. With clip injury (pure valgus stress), bone marrow oedema is usually most prominent in the lateral femoral condyle secondary to the direct blow, whereas a second smaller area of oedema may be present in the medial femoral condyle secondary to avulsive stress to the MCL (mostly at the femoral attachment)",

      explanation: "Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener’s granulomatosis, affects small to medium-sized vessels and most commonly involves the upper and lower respiratory tracts and kidneys. In comparison to adults, children are more likely to have multi-organ involvement with renal disease, subglottic stenosis, nasal deformity and pulmonary findings. Differential diagnosis of GPA may include those that present with pulmonary-renal features such as mixed connective tissue diseases, Goodpasture syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus. Takayasu arteritis is a large-vessel vasculitis with characteristic abnormalities of the aorta and its main branches. Kawasaki’s disease and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) are medium vessel vasculitides. The hallmark imaging feature in Kawasaki’s disease includes coronary artery aneurysms. In PAN, angiographic findings of aneurysms, stenoses or occlusions of medium-sized vessels is a key diagnostic criterion. This is predominantly seen in renal and mesenteric arteries, although not pathognomonic. Cogan’s syndrome is an autoimmune disorder characterised by interstitial keratitis and bilateral audiovestibular deficits.

The most common manifestation of asbestos exposure is pleural plaques that usually arise from the parietal pleura but may arise from visceral pleura. Calcification is reported in 10%–15%. The classic distribution of plaques is the posterolateral chest wall, lateral chest wall, the dome of the diaphragm (virtually pathognomonic) and the mediastinal pleura. The apices and costophrenic angles are typically spared. Diffuse pleural thickening is less specific for asbestos exposure. Asbestos-related round atelectasis is also known as asbestos pseudotumour and is related to fibrosis in the superficial layers of the pleura. Asbestosis is the term given to lung fibrosis caused by asbestos. The changes are more pronounced in the lower lobes and subpleurally but often extend to involve the middle lobe and lingula. Malignant mesothelioma and bronchogenic carcinoma are known associations. High-density consolidation is typical of amiodarone lung changes",

      answer: "Pneumobilia",
      explanation: "Of all the hollow viscera, the stomach is the least commonly affected by gas-forming infections. Of the 30 reported cases in the literature, caustic ingestion (37%) and alcohol abuse (22%) were found to be the most common causes. Other predisposing conditions include recent gastroduodenal surgery, trauma and gastric infarction. Caustic ingestion of acid is thought to promote coagulative necrosis of the gastric lumen, whereas ingestion of an alkaline substance leads to liquefactive necrosis; in either case, the end result is mucosal damage and super infection with gas-forming bacteria. There are no predilections with regard to age, sex or diabetic status. Clinical manifestation may be dramatic, ranging from acute sepsis to gastric haemorrhage and, rarely, vomiting of the necrotic stomach cast. CT is considered the modality of choice for detection of intramural gas and evaluation for the presence of pneumoperitoneum or portal venous gas. CT may also demonstrate irregular mucosal fold thickening and may be used to monitor response to treatment or disease progression. An important differential diagnosis to consider is benign gastric emphysema. Gas collections form within the gastric wall without associated infection by gas-forming organisms. Gas may enter the wall from the lumen, peritoneal surface or oesophageal or duodenal connection and is usually associated with violent coughing, vomiting or severe obstructive pulmonary disease. Gastric fold inflammation and thickening are not present, and the patient is usually asymptomatic with spontaneous resolution expected",

      answer: "Transient synovitis",
      explanation: "Acute transient synovitis is the most common non-traumatic cause of hip pain in young children. It tends to affect children between 2 and 9 years of age and boys are affected two to four times more often. Where history is typical no imaging may be required; ultrasound can be used to identify the effusion. Initial bone scan uptake can be reduced, mimicking SUFE, but can increase later on. Juvenile arthritis affects children above 4–5 years of age. Radiographs may show erosions and loss of joint space. MRI and ultrasound are more sensitive for soft-tissue changes, allowing demonstration of synovitis, distinguishing pannus from simple effusion and identifying cartilage destruction and cortical erosions. Septic arthritis is an emergency. The majority of patients are less than 2 years old and are usually unwell with pain on passive movement of the hip. Avascular necrosis (AVN) of the femoral head is a condition induced by compromised blood supply, resulting in progressive destruction of bone. It is most commonly idiopathic (Perthes) but may be seen following trauma, infection, steroid treatment and in association with haematological diseases, such as sickle cell anaemia. Perthes disease usually affects children between 4 and 10 years of age and is more common in boys. Plain radiography is insensitive at early changes. The epiphysis may appear small, sclerotic or flattened with subchondral lucency or more marked fragmentation. Where symmetrical changes are seen, hypothyroidism or epiphyseal dysplasia should be considered. Meyer’s dysplasia mimics Perthes disease unilaterally by appearance but is asymptomatic",

Ulceration of an aortic atheroma occurs in patients with advanced atherosclerosis.

On MRI, cholesterol granulomas are typically hyperintense on both T1 and T2-weighted sequences because of the accumulation of blood breakdown products and proteinaceous debris. Small lesions may be relatively homogeneous, whereas large lesions show more heterogeneity.

On MR images, chondroblastomas are seen as epiphyseal lesions with high T2 signal intensity surrounded by a halo of oedema in the adjacent marrow and soft tissues. A characteristic thin (<1 mm) low-signal-intensity ring that corresponds to peripheral sclerosis is seen in more than 90%. Fluid–fluid levels similar to Aneurysmal bone cyst (ABCs) are seen in 20%–30% of cases. Differential considerations include epiphyseal osteomyelitis and osteoid osteoma. Neuroblastoma metastasis and Langerhans cell hystiocytosis can also affect the epiphyses. Simple bone cyst (SBC), fibrous cortical defects and ABC affect the metaphysis",

There is no significant difference between genders. There have been conflicting data regarding the distribution of PG among CD and UC; however there is no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Erythema nodosum is more common in CD than in UC. The occurrence of lesions parallels intestinal disease activity, and lesions frequently resolve when bowel disease subsides; thus, treatment is usually aimed at the underlying bowel disease. At times, erythema nodosum can precede bowel exacerbations and can require treatment with oral steroids. Based on these findings, patients with idiopathic EN should be evaluated for IBD",

      answer: "Glomus jugulare",
      explanation: "About 80% of all paragangliomas are either carotid body tumours or glomus jugulare tumours. The typical CT appearance of a carotid body tumour is a well-defined soft-tissue mass within the carotid space of the infrahyoid neck. The underlying hypervascularity of the tumour results in homogeneous and intense enhancement following intravenous administration of contrast material. Splaying of the common carotid bifurcation is very suggestive of a carotid body tumour. On high-resolution CT scans of the temporal bones, expansion and erosion of the jugular foramen characterise the glomus jugulare tumour. The tumour spreads along the paths of least resistance and is initially directed superiorly owing to the intrinsic weakness of this part of the jugular fossa. Subsequently, the hypotympanum, mesotympanum and the sinus tympani are invaded. Ossicular chain destruction is common. Inferior spread of the tumour produces infiltration of the IJV (internal jugular vein) and infratemporal fossa. Paragangliomas typically exhibit a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. As with CT, homogeneous and intense enhancement is noted following the intravenous administration of contrast material. Multiple serpentine and punctate areas of signal void characterise the typical paraganglioma with all MR sequences; these areas are variably distributed throughout the mass and are believed to represent flow voids in the larger intratumoural vessels (salt-and-pepper appearance)",

      answer: "The aortic wall appears thinned out",
      explanation: "Aortic intramural hematoma may occur as a primary event in hypertensive patients from spontaneous bleeding from the vasa vasorum into the media or may be caused by a penetrating atherosclerotic ulcer. Intramural hematoma can also develop in blunt chest trauma with aortic wall injury. The hematoma propagates along the media layer of the aorta. Consequently, intramural hematoma weakens the aorta and may progress either to outward rupture of the aortic wall or to inward disruption of the intima, the latter leading to communicating aortic dissection. Intramural hematoma can be distinguished from mural thrombus by identification of the intima: mural thrombus lies on top of the intima, which is frequently calcified, whereas intramural hematoma is subintimal. On unenhanced CT, intramural hematoma is hyperdense. MR imaging aids in the distinction of slow flow in the false lumen of a dissection from no flow in an intramural hematoma. Dynamic post-contrast MR imaging is more sensitive for excluding slow flow in the thickened aortic wall, which would indicate aortic dissection rather than intramural hematoma",

      answer: "No further management is required",
      explanation: "Typical indications for spinal US in newborns and infants are skin-covered masses and midline cutaneous malformations of the back (e.g., dimple, haemangiomatous or hairy lesion), which are suggestive of associated dysraphic anomalies of the spinal cord. Spinal dysraphism is often associated with tethering of the spinal cord. The US appearance of tethering is a low-lying or blunt-ended conus medullaris due to abnormal fixation of the spinal cord. Moreover, movement of the spinal cord and cauda equina can be evaluated with real-time US with M-mode scanning. Typically, the tethered cord is positioned eccentrically and demonstrates reduced or absent movement. Dorsal dermal sinus manifests as a small dimple or pinpoint ostium, which is often associated with an area of hyperpigmented, angiomatous skin or hypertrichosis and occurs in a midline location or rarely in a paramedian location. Soft-tissue asymmetry and bone anomalies are common findings. Typical complications are infections such as recurrent meningitis, epidural or subdural abscess, and intramedullary spinal cord abscess. In particular, dorsal dermal sinus occurring in a paramedian location is often associated with an intraspinal dermoid or epidermoid cyst, which causes compression of neural structures with neurologic symptoms. For these reasons, dorsal dermal sinus has to be differentiated from simple sacral dimple or pilonidal sinus. The latter two anomalies do not extend to neural structures",

Fat pad displacement is independent of fracture displacement and comminution.

      response: "",
      answer: "MR contrast agent is routinely used in pregnancy",
      explanation: "The present data have not conclusively documented any deleterious effects of MR imaging exposure on the developing foetus. Therefore no special consideration is recommended for the first, versus any other, trimester in pregnancy. Nevertheless, as with all interventions during pregnancy, it is prudent to screen women of reproductive age for pregnancy before permitting them access to MR imaging environments. If pregnancy is established, consideration should be given to reassessing the potential risks versus benefits of the pending study in determining whether the requested MR examination could safely wait to the end of the pregnancy before being performed. Pregnant patients can be accepted to undergo MR scans at any stage of pregnancy if the information requested from the MR study cannot be acquired by means of non-ionising means (e.g., ultrasonography), the data are needed to potentially affect the care of the patient or foetus during the pregnancy, or the referring physician believes that it is not prudent to wait until the patient is no longer pregnant to obtain these data. MR contrast agents should not be routinely provided to pregnant patients. The decision to administer a gadolinium-based MR contrast agent to pregnant patients should be accompanied by a well-documented risk–benefit analysis. There should be overwhelming potential benefit to the patient or foetus outweighing the theoretical but potentially real risks of long-term exposure of the foetus to free gadolinium ions. Studies have demonstrated that at least some of the gadolinium-based MR contrast agents readily pass through the placental barrier and enter the foetal circulation. From here, they are filtered in the foetal kidneys and then excreted into the amniotic fluid. In this location, the gadolinium-chelate molecules are in a relatively protected space and may remain for an indeterminate amount of time before finally being reabsorbed and eliminated. The longer the chelated molecule remains in the amniotic cavity, the greater the potential for dissociation of the potentially toxic gadolinium ion from its ligand. It is unclear what impact such free gadolinium ions might have if they were to be released in any quantity in the amniotic fluid. Certainly, deposition into the developing foetus would raise concerns of possible secondary adverse effects. The risk to the foetus of gadolinium-based MR contrast agent administration remains unknown; it may be harmful",

Changes often start at the lumbar spine. • Ankylosing spondylitis is a recognised cause; associated findings helping in narrowing the diagnosis. • Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate deposition disease (CPPD), haemochromatosis and hypervitaminosis D can result in calcification of the annulus fibrosus. • Transient intervertebral disc calcification is seen in children, typically in the cervical spine and spontaneously regresses. • Other recognised causes of disc calcification include juvenile chronic arthritis, amyloidosis, poliomyelitis, acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism, trauma and post-operative discs",

      explanation: "Imaging is crucial in delineating the extent of local tumour extension, as well as detecting nodal metastases, which are present in the vast majority of patients at the time of diagnosis (75%–90%). Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) usually presents with intermediate signal intensity, higher than the muscle signal, on T2-weighted images, low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and enhance to a lesser degree than does normal mucosa. Eighty-two percent of NPCs arise in the posterolateral recess of the pharyngeal wall (Rosenmüller fossa). Larger/more aggressive tumours may extend into any direction, eroding the base of skull and passing via the Eustachian tube, foramen lacerum, foramen ovale or directly through bone into the clivus, cavernous sinus and temporal bone. Invasion of the parapharyngeal space is associated with an increased risk of distant metastases and tumour recurrence. Following administration of contrast, the tumour mass and nodal metastases usually demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement. Careful assessment of cervical lymph nodes is essential due to the high rate of nodal involvement at the time of diagnosis. Cranial nerve involvement and venous occlusion is best demonstrated on post-contrast MRI",

      answer: "Chronic hepatitis",
      explanation: "There are a number of recognised risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma that all share the common feature of chronic biliary inflammation. Among these risk factors, infection with liver flukes (e.g., Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis) and hepatolithiasis are common causes of cholangiocarcinoma in endemic areas. Dietary or endogenous nitrosamine compounds associated with parasitic infections also play an important role as cofactors in carcinogenesis, probably due to the carcinogenic effect of nitrosamine compounds on the proliferation of epithelial cells of the bile duct. Cholangiocarcinoma arising from a cirrhotic liver may be surrounded by a fibrotic pseudocapsule, which is an unusual finding in cholangiocarcinoma arising from a non-cirrhotic liver. In such cases, capsular retraction is noted along the tumour surface. This capsular retraction may be seen in some hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) with cirrhotic stroma but is more suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma. Cholangiocarcinoma can develop in a congenital choledochal cyst, with a lifetime risk of 10%–15%. In addition, a European study showed that a history of alcohol-related liver disease, cirrhosis, various bile-duct diseases, chronic inflammatory bowel disease or diabetes may increase the risk of development of cholangiocarcinoma",

      explanation: "Struma ovarii is a rare ovarian lesion that accounts for 2% of ovarian teratomas. Struma ovarii is a highly specialised form of ovarian teratoma and is composed entirely or predominantly of thyroid tissue. About 5% of patients develop clinical evidence of hyperthyroidism. At US, struma ovarii has a non-specific solid, cystic appearance. MRI demonstrates a loculated cystic mass with variable signal characteristics. Cystic spaces may show marked T2 hypointensity and intermediate T1 signal intensity due to the thick, gelatinous colloid of the struma. Some locules may contain microscopic fat, as indicated by signal drop-off and chemical shift artefact on opposed-phase T1-weighted MRI. Struma ovarii typically demonstrates strong enhancement of the solid components on post-contrast T1-weighted MRI. Struma ovarii are benign in 95% of cases and usually occur in premenopausal women; therefore, preoperative diagnosis is essential to avoid unnecessary radical surgery",

      answer: "External laryngocele",
      explanation: "Simply stated, a laryngocele is a dilated laryngeal saccule, and there are three types: internal, external and mixed. Approximately 40% of laryngoceles are internal; these laryngoceles are confined to the larynx and do not pierce the thyrohyoid membrane. External laryngoceles (26% of cases) extend through the thyrohyoid membrane at the point of insertion of the superior laryngeal nerve and vessels (neurovascular bundle). The component superficial to the thyrohyoid membrane is dilated, and the saccular portion inside the membrane is normal in size. Finally, mixed laryngoceles (44% of cases) have abnormal dilatation of the saccule on both sides of the thyrohyoid membrane. The association of laryngocele with laryngeal carcinoma is well documented: Investigators worldwide have reported an increased frequency of laryngoceles in patients with laryngeal carcinoma. On CT scans, a laryngocele appears as a well-defined, smooth mass in the lateral aspect of the superior paralaryngeal space. Internal laryngoceles will be limited by the thyrohyoid membrane. External and mixed laryngoceles lie superficial to the thyrohyoid membrane at the point of insertion of the superior laryngeal nerve and vessels (neurovascular bundle). The attenuation of these lesions may vary, depending on the amount of secretions, air and soft tissue from an associated laryngeal neoplasm",

The most common sites of involvement are the body of the mandible and the alveolar ridge or the antral area of the maxilla. It may be secondary to radiation, fibrous dysplasia, Paget disease, trauma, osteomyelitis, ossifying fibroma and giant cell tumour. On CT, the tumour displays a spectrum of bone changes from well-demarcated borders, notably the low-grade osteosarcoma (uncommon), to lytic bone destruction with indefinite margin and variable cortical bone erosion, to the osteoblastic form, where the bone is sclerotic. The majority of osteosarcomas have matrix mineralisation, calcifications of the osteoid or osteoid-like substance within the tumour and some tumours show a sunburst effect caused by radiating mineralised tumour spiculae. Ewing’s sarcoma can also occur in this area, although the expected age would be younger. On CT, it often shows the characteristic onion-skin appearance of periosteal reaction and less often a sunburst type of periosteal reaction",

Foetal MRI may detect subtle neural tube defects not shown by US and determine the level of the defect in myelomeningocele for potential foetal surgery. The next common indication for foetal MRI is evaluation of suspicious thoracic masses. MRI has the advantage over US in differentiating the liver and bowel loops from lung tissue or masses; this aids in differentiating a congenital diaphragmatic hernia from a pulmonary mass. MRI could be helpful in providing tissue characterisation of foetal abdominal masses when US study is non-specific. MRI is particularly useful in the assessment of pregnancies complicated by oligohydramnios, which can limit the diagnostic sensitivity of US",

      answer: "Synovial cyst",
      explanation: "Intraspinal synovial cysts are extradural lesions that arise from the synovial lining of the facet joints. Most cysts are found at the L4–L5 facet joint, as this is the level where the most biomechanical spinal motion occurs. The differential diagnosis for synovial cysts includes arachnoid cysts, perineural (Tarlov) cysts, schwannomas and migrated herniated disk fragments. The MR imaging characteristics and the neuroanatomic location of the cyst help distinguish synovial cysts from these other lesions. Extradural arachnoid cysts are cerebrospinal fluid-filled outpouchings of the arachnoid membranes that extend through a defect in the dura mater. Two-thirds of these lesions occur in the thoracic spine; this helps to differentiate these masses from synovial cysts, which occur most frequently in the lumbar spine. Perineural cysts can be distinguished from synovial cysts because perineural cysts are separate from the facet and are intimately associated with the nerve root. Likewise, schwannomas can be distinguished from synovial cysts on MR images by their intimate association with the nerve root. Furthermore, the propensity for schwannomas to enhance homogeneously after administration of a gadolinium-containing contrast agent helps one distinguish this entity from synovial cysts, which typically demonstrate only rim enhancement. Migrated disk fragments are sometimes found dorsal to the thecal sac, which complicates their differentiation from synovial cysts. They can, however, be distinguished reliably by their relationship to the ligamentum flavum, their signal intensity characteristics and their lack of degenerative changes in the facet joint. Migrated disk fragments are typically located anterior to the ligamentum flavum, whereas synovial cysts are located dorsal to or inseparable from the ligamentum flavum. Furthermore, migrated disk fragments are usually lobulated and have lower signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images than do the spherically shaped synovial cysts",

      answer: "Metacarpophalangeal joint (MCPJ)",
      explanation: "Primary OA describes degenerative joint disease with no local aetiological factor. It is age related and caused by high mechanical forces of a repetitive nature on a normal joint. Secondary OA describes degenerative changes within a joint with an underlying aetiological factor. These may include trauma, CPPD, inflammatory arthritis, haemochromatosis, developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), AVN or loose bodies. The joints most commonly involved in primary OA are distal interphalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, first carpometacarpal joint, hips, knees, spine and first metatarsophalangeal. The joints commonly spared include metacarpophalangeal, wrist, elbow, shoulder and ankles",

      stem: "Cervical spine MRI of a 37-year-old woman with neck pain, tingling and numbness in the left C5–C7 distribution showed a well-defined intradural mass with signal characteristic similar to spinal cord in both T1W and T2W sequences. The cord was displaced posteriorly without any intrinsic signal change. Intense enhancement was noted on the post-contrast images with a dural tail. What is the diagnosis?",

      response: "",
      answer: "Meningioma",
      explanation: "Meningiomas are well circumscribed and show avid enhancement on contrast-enhanced imaging. On CT, they are iso/hyperattenuating. The hyperattenuation reflects the cellular nature of these lesions, but the presence of calcification also contributes. Hyperostosis may be seen but is not as common as in the intracranial forms. This is due, in part, to the more prominent epidural fat within the spine. They are most commonly isointense on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging. Some may be hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and flow voids may be seen. If they are densely calcified, they will show low signal on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted imaging. Meningiomas prominently enhance on contrast-enhanced imaging, and a dural tail may be observed. On MRI, paragangliomas are well circumscribed and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and avidly enhance on contrast-enhanced imaging. The classic salt and pepper appearance associated with head and neck paragangliomas may be seen. The entire spine should be imaged because of the possibility of intradural metastasis. Because of the highly vascular nature, prominent flow voids in and around the tumour commonly occur. A low-signal hemosiderin rim may be seen on T2-weighted images",

      response: "",
      answer: "Superior mesenteric artery located to the right of the superior mesenteric vein",
      explanation: "The upper GI series remains the imaging reference standard for the diagnosis of malrotation with or without volvulus. The normal position of the DJ junction is to the left of the left-sided pedicles of the vertebral body at the level of the duodenal bulb on frontal views and posterior (retroperitoneal) on lateral views. In children with acute duodenal obstruction, the upper GI series may depict a Z-shaped configuration of the duodenum in the presence of obstructing peritoneal bands or a corkscrew-shaped duodenum in the presence of volvulus. In children who have bowel malrotation without volvulus, the upper GI series shows an abnormal position of the DJ junction. The detection of the double bubble sign suggests duodenal obstruction. In infants in whom the radiograph demonstrates a double bubble, one should consider both intrinsic and extrinsic causes of obstruction. The intrinsic causes are duodenal atresia, duodenal stenosis and duodenal webs; the extrinsic causes include annular pancreas, malrotation of the gut with obstruction produced by mid-gut volvulus or by Ladd bands and preduodenal position of the portal vein. The proximal left-sided bubble is the air- and fluid-filled stomach. The duodenum represents the second bubble to the right of the midline. The third part of the duodenum is a retroperitoneal structure. Normally SMV is to the right of the SMA. Distended bowel loops throughout the abdomen would exclude any significant mid-gut obstruction",
