      response: "",
      answer: "Cardiac fibroelastomas usually arise from the pericardium",
      explanation: "Most lipomas appear to be subepicardial, expanding into the pericardial space. They typically have high signal on T1-weighted images and low signal on fat-suppressed images. Fibroelastomas occur on cardiac valves, making them the most common neoplasm of the valves. They are hypointense mobile masses situated away from the free edge of the valves. Fibroma is a neoplasm primarily of infants and children. Fibromas are homogeneously hypointense on T2-weighted images and show variable enhancement. Rhabdomyomas are the most common benign cardiac tumour of childhood associated with tuberous sclerosis. They originate within the myocardium, typically in the ventricles, may be multiple, and are high on T2-weighted images. The majority of myxomas manifest in adulthood between the fourth and seventh decades. A minority will constitute part of an autosomal dominant syndrome known as Carney complex, characterised by myxomas, hyperpigmented skin lesions and extracardiac tumours such as pituitary adenomas, breast fibroadenomas and melanotic schwannomas. The classic triad of symptoms attributed to myxomas include cardiac obstructive symptoms related to obstruction to blood flow, embolic events and constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise and weight loss. At MR imaging, the vast majority of myxomas demonstrate heterogeneous signal intensity. The main differential diagnoses for myxoma include atrial thrombus or papillary fibroelastoma. Myxomas are more likely to arise anteriorly from the interatrial septum, whereas thrombus is more likely located posteriorly in the left atrium. In addition, myxomas enhance with gadolinium contrast material, whereas thrombi, in most cases, do not",

      answer: "Cystosarcoma phyllodes",
      explanation: "Phylloides tumour (PT) is a rare breast fibroepithelial neoplasm. It is now generally accepted that PTs can be classified as benign, borderline or malignant. Mammography and ultrasound are notorious for their inability to distinguish the benign or malignant histologic nature of PTs. On US, they can be indistinguishable from fibroadenoma. They appear as an inhomogeneous, solid-appearing mass. A solid mass containing single or multiple, round or cleft-like cystic spaces and demonstrating posterior acoustic enhancement strongly suggests a diagnosis of PTs. Solid components of the tumour show vascularity on Doppler. On MRI, well-defined margins with a round or lobulated shape and a septate inner structure have been described as characteristic morphologic signs. They are usually low on T1-weighted images and vary from low to very high signal on T2-weighted images. Some have described a silt-like pattern on MRIs of benign PTs; these appear as hyperintense slit-like fluid-filled spaces on T2-weighted images, with a low signal after enhancement.

There is an interim period of 2 weeks when it is isodense to brain tissue. In addition to variation in appearance over time, subdural haemorrhage may have a variable appearance in a setting of systemic disease like anaemia and coagulopathy. An acute SDH can appear isodense in the following settings: anaemia with a haemoglobin concentration of <10 g/dL, admixture of CSF in the subdural space caused by an associated tear to the arachnoid layer and disseminated intravascular coagulation. If there is chronic CSF leakage of venous blood, for example, if the patient has coagulopathy or is on anticoagulants/antiplatelet agents, chronic haematoma may look isodense rather than hypodense.

      response: "",
      answer: "Takayasu arteritis",
      explanation: "Takayasu arteritis is a form of granulomatous vasculitis affecting large and medium-sized arteries, characterised by ocular disturbances and weak pulses in the upper extremities (pulseless disease). It is associated with fibrous thickening of the aortic arch with narrowing of the origins of the great vessels at the arch. Takayasu arteritis can be limited to the descending thoracic and abdominal aorta. It is seen in young and middle-aged patients, especially Asian and women. The diagnosis is confirmed by a characteristic arteriographic pattern of irregular vessel walls, stenosis, post-stenotic dilatation, aneurysm formation, occlusion and evidence of increased collateral circulation. Polyarteritis nodosa is a fibrinoid necrotising vasculitis that mainly involves small and medium-sized arteries of the muscles. Multiple aneurysm formation is a characteristic finding. The kidney is most commonly involved, followed by the GI tract, liver, spleen and pancreas. Positive ANCA titres (usually pANCA type) are found in variable percentages of patients. Wegener’s granulomatosis is a distinct clinicopathologic entity characterised by granulomatous vasculitis of the upper and lower respiratory tract together with glomerulonephritis. Churg–Strauss syndrome is characterised by granulomatous vasculitis of multiple organ systems, particularly the lung, and involves both arteries and veins as well as pulmonary and systemic vessels. Moyamoya disease is a progressive vasculopathy leading to stenosis of the main intracranial arteries. Characteristic angiographic features of the disease include stenosis or occlusion of the arteries of the circle of Willis, as well as the development of collateral vasculature that produces a typical angiographic image called ‘clouds of smoke’ or ‘puff of cigarette smoke’",

      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Pott disease",
      explanation: "Infection usually begins in the anterior part of the vertebral body adjacent to the end plate. Subsequent demineralisation of the end plate results in loss of definition of its dense margins on conventional radiographs. These end plate changes allow the spread of infection to the adjacent intervertebral disk, resulting in a classic pattern of involvement of more than one vertebral body together with the intervening disks. It also allows spread into the paraspinal tissues, resulting in the formation of a paravertebral abscess. However, if there is anterior subligamentous involvement of the spine, infection can extend both superiorly and inferiorly, with sparing of the intervertebral disks. A normal chest radiograph is present in up to 50% of cases. In the later stages of disease, there is often vertebral collapse with a gibbus deformity. Tuberculosis rarely affects the posterior vertebral elements (including the pedicles), in contrast to metastatic disease. Anterior scalloping seen with subligamentous spread of infection can also be seen with paravertebral lymphadenopathy, secondary to metastases or lymphoma. In differentiating tuberculosis from pyogenic infection, the clinical picture is as important as the radiologic features, with insidious onset of symptoms, a normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate, relevant respiratory symptoms and slow disease progression favouring a diagnosis of tuberculosis. Radiologic features that favour this diagnosis include involvement of one or more segments; a delay in destruction of the intervertebral disks; a large, calcified paravertebral mass; and the absence of sclerosis. Sarcoidosis can produce multifocal lesions of vertebrae and disks, along with paraspinal masses that appear identical to tuberculosis",

      response: "",
      answer: "Hallervorden–Spatz disease",
      explanation: "The ‘eye of the tiger’ sign represents marked low signal intensity of the globus palladi on T2-weighted MRI, surrounding a central, small hyperintense area. The sign is seen in what was once known as Hallervorden–Spatz (HS) syndrome but is now called neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) or pantothenate kinase II (PANC2)-associated neurodegeneration. The low signal is a result of excessive iron accumulation and the central high signal is attributed to gliosis, increased water content and neuronal loss with disintegration. Iron levels in blood and CSF are normal. HS is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with extrapyramidal dysfunction and dementia. The sign can also be seen in other extrapyramidal Parkinsonian disorders such as cortical-basal ganglionic degeneration, Steele–Richardson–Olszewski syndrome, and early onset levodopa-responsive Parkinsonism",

Abdominal and pelvic tumours are usually large and heterogeneous, and approximately 80%–90% demonstrate calcification on CT scans. Low attenuation areas of necrosis or haemorrhage are frequently noted at CT. Vascular encasement and compression of the renal vessels, splenic vein, inferior vena cava, aorta, celiac artery and superior mesenteric artery may occur, and vascular invasion is rare. Regional invasion of the psoas and paraspinal musculature may occur, and invasion of the neural foramen into the epidural space is also frequent; these are better evaluated at MR imaging, as is regional organ invasion.

It usually represents a rare complication of myocardial infarction, but it may also occur after cardiac surgery, chest trauma and endocarditis. True left ventricular aneurysms are discrete, dyskinetic areas of the left ventricular wall with a broad neck. Unlike a true aneurysm, which contains some myocardial elements in its wall, the walls of a false aneurysm are composed of organised haematoma and pericardium only. Both demonstrate focal bulge to the cardiac contour and can calcify.

      response: "",
      answer: "Quadrilateral space syndrome",
      explanation: "The anatomy of the suprascapular nerve renders it particularly susceptible to compression at the suprascapular notch and spinoglenoid notch. The pattern of muscle denervation provides information about the duration of entrapment and can identify the site of neurologic compromise. Acute denervation presents as hyperintensity of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus or of the infraspinatus muscle alone on fluid-sensitive sequences. Chronic compression is shown as a reduction in muscle bulk and fatty infiltration of the involved muscles. Involvement of both the supra- and infraspinatus muscles reflects proximal compression at the suprascapular notch, whereas isolated infraspinatus denervation suggests compression at the spinoglenoid notch. Quadrilateral space syndrome is a rare condition referring to an isolated compressive neuropathy of the axillary nerve. It generally results in isolated atrophy of the teres minor and, less commonly, of the deltoid, which appears as a reduction in muscle bulk and fatty infiltration with chronic compression. Parsonage–Turner syndrome is an uncommon, self-limiting disorder characterised by sudden onset of non-traumatic shoulder pain associated with progressive weakness of the shoulder girdle musculature. MRI is the technique of choice in patients with shoulder pain and weakness. It is sensitive for the detection of signal abnormalities in the shoulder girdle musculature related to denervation injury. MRI is also useful in excluding intrinsic shoulder abnormalities that can produce symptoms similar to Parsonage–Turner syndrome such as rotator cuff tears, impingement syndrome and labral tears",

      response: "",
      answer: "Sacral chordoma",
      explanation: "A chordoma is a tumour that derives from notochordal remnants. At imaging, it typically manifests as a large, destructive sacral mass with secondary soft-tissue extension. Radiographs may show sacral osteolysis with an associated soft-tissue mass and calcifications. CT shows bone destruction with an associated lobulated midline soft-tissue mass. Areas of low attenuation within the mass reflect the myxoid properties (high water content) of the tissue. Areas of punctate calcification often are noted. At MR imaging, the most striking feature is the high signal intensity seen on T2-weighted images. High T2 signal intensity is a non-specific feature; however, the combination of high T2 signal intensity and a lobulated sacral mass that contains areas of haemorrhage and calcification is strongly suggestive of a chordoma. Chordomas tend to show hypointense or isointense signal relative to that in muscle on T1-weighted images, and contrast-enhanced images show a modest degree of heterogeneous enhancement in the soft-tissue components of the tumour. Areas of intrinsic T1 signal hyperintensity typically represent areas of haemorrhage or mucinous material. The tumour may cross the sacroiliac joint",

      answer: "Type II endoleak",
      explanation: "In a Type I endoleak, there is poor apposition between one of the attachment sites of a stent graft and the native aortic or iliac artery wall, and blood leaks through this defect into the aneurysm sac. A Type I endoleak can be seen immediately after stent-graft deployment. On CT, dense contrast collection is usually seen centrally within the sac and is often continuous with one of the attachment sites. Type II endoleaks are the most common. They occur when there is retrograde flow of blood into the aneurysm sac via an excluded aortic branch, most commonly IMA or a lumbar artery. Many Type II endoleaks close spontaneously over time. CT shows peripheral or central location of acute haemorrhage. Leakage of blood through the body of a stent graft results in a Type III endoleak. Type III endoleaks manifest as collections of haemorrhage or contrast material centrally within the aneurysm sac, usually distant from the attachment sites or native vessels. Opacification of the aneurysm sac immediately after placement of a stent graft without a discernible source of leakage is designated a Type IV endoleak. A Type V endoleak, or endotension, is characterised by continued growth of an excluded aneurysm sac without direct radiologic evidence of a leak",

      answer: "Homogenous high T2 signal suggests malignancy",
      explanation: "Smooth margins, characterised by well-defined and sharply demarcated borders, are the feature with the highest benign lesion predictive value. Round and oval shapes have also been found to be predictive of benignity. Homogeneous enhancement is highly suggestive of benign nature. Fat content is specific to benign lesions, such as hamartoma, fibroadenoma, intramammary lymph nodes or fat necrosis. In the case of fat necrosis, even if the lesion appears irregular in both shape and margin, with rim enhancement, the key to diagnosis is a fat internal signal on unenhanced sequences without fat suppression. Strong hypersignal on non-fat-suppressed T2-weighted sequences is classically considered to be a clear sign of fibroadenoma, but it is non-specific and is seen in mucinous carcinomas, invasive ductal carcinomas, metaplastic carcinomas and intracystic papillary carcinomas (although it does not have a homogenously high T2 signal as fibroadenoma). Although rim enhancement is regarded as suggestive of malignancy, a regular enhanced rim, which may be thick, may be seen around cysts, seroma (both of which are high T2 fluid signal) and fat necrosis (high T1 signal). In relation to enhancement kinematics, a centrifugal contrast uptake pattern may help in diagnosing a fibroadenoma, whereas a centripetal spread of contrast is more common in carcinomas",

      answer: "Disruption of the spinolamellar line",
      explanation: "The atlantoaxial interval is defined as the distance between the anterior aspect of the dens and the posterior aspect of the anterior ring of the atlas. This distance should be 5 mm or less. Pseudospread of the atlas on the axis (‘pseudo–Jefferson fracture’) can be seen on anterior open-mouth radiographs. Up to 6 mm of displacement of the lateral masses relative to the dens is common in patients up to 4 years old and may be seen in patients up to 7 years old. On extension radiographs, overriding of the anterior arch of the atlas onto the odontoid process can be seen in 20% of healthy children. In children, the C2–3 space and, to a lesser extent, the C3–4 space have a normal physiologic displacement. The absence of lordosis, although potentially pathologic in an adult, can be seen in children up to 16 years of age when the neck is in a neutral position. In children, the flexion manoeuvre can increase the distance between the tips of the C1 and C2 spinous processes. Normal posterior intraspinous distance is a good indicator of ligamentous integrity and should not be more than 1.5 times greater than the intraspinous distance one level either above or below the level in question. Anterior wedging of up to 3 mm of the vertebral bodies should not be confused with compression fracture. Such wedging can be profound at the C3 level. A prevertebral space of less than 6 mm at the level of C3 is considered normal in children. In paediatric patients, widening of the prevertebral soft tissues can be a normal finding that is related to expiration. Disruption of the spinolamellar line is a sign of injury",

      explanation: "In the early post-operative period (<72 hours after transplantation), increased hepatic artery resistance (resistive index of >0.8) is a frequent finding, but resistance ordinarily returns to a normal level within a few days. Increased hepatic artery resistance is associated with older donor age and a prolonged period of ischaemia. The estimated incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis among liver transplant recipients is 4%–12% in adults and 42% in children. This is one of the most feared complications, as it may lead to fulminant hepatic necrosis. In addition, in liver grafts, biliary ducts are supplied exclusively by small branches of the hepatic artery; therefore, arterial thrombosis may lead to biliary ischaemia and necrosis. Prompt diagnosis of hepatic artery thrombosis is extremely important because early intervention (with thrombectomy, hepatic artery reconstruction or both) may allow graft salvage. However, most patients ultimately require retransplantation. Even after retransplantation, the mortality rate approaches 30%. Risk factors for hepatic artery thrombosis include a significant difference in hepatic artery calibre between the donor and the recipient, an interpositional conduit for the anastomosis, a previous stenotic lesion of the celiac axis, excessive duration of cold ischaemia time, ABO blood type incompatibility, cytomegalovirus infection and acute rejection",

      explanation: "MR imaging is the best non-invasive method for measuring the level of iron in the liver for the purposes of confirming the diagnosis, determining the severity, and monitoring therapy with high sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values. The accumulation of iron ions in the tissues, because of the super-paramagnetic properties of the ions, causes local distortion in the magnetic fields and relaxation of the spins, which results in shortening of the longitudinal relaxation time (T1), the transverse relaxation time (T2) and particularly the transverse relaxation time as affected by magnetic field inhomogeneity (T2*). This effect causes a loss of signal intensity in the affected organs that is proportional to the iron deposition. In the general protocol applied to an abdominal study, it is not possible to estimate the hepatic iron concentration, although most of the time it is possible to diagnose iron overload. This can be done by using ‘dual sequence’ (gradient in and out of phase) MR imaging, which demonstrates decreased signal intensity in the affected tissues on the in-phase images compared with the out of-phase images. That effect is the opposite of the effect observed in patients with steatosis. This occurs because the echo time of the in-phase sequence is usually higher than that of the out-of-phase sequence; therefore, the in-phase pulse sequence is more sensitive to iron deposits because of the increased T2* effect",

On US, it appears as a hypoechoic or anechoic mass with ill- or well-defined margins, with or without acoustic shadowing or as a complex cyst.

Ependymomas enhance intensely after intravenous administration of iodinated contrast material. Most spinal cord ependymomas are iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images. Any hyperintensity suggests haemorrhage. They are hyperintense to the cord on T2-weighted images. About 20%–33% of ependymomas demonstrate the cap sign, a rim of extreme hypointensity (hemosiderin) seen at the poles of the tumour on T2-weighted images. This finding is secondary to haemorrhage, which is common in ependymomas and other highly vascular tumours (e.g., paraganglioma, haemangioblastoma) Most cases (60%) also show evidence of cord oedema around the masses. The average number of vertebral segments involved with abnormal signal intensity is 3.6. Cysts are a common feature, with 78%–84% of ependymomas having at least one cyst. Subependymomas represent a variant of central nervous system (CNS) ependymomas.

      explanation: "Hypogenetic lung syndrome, also known as congenital venolobar syndrome or scimitar syndrome, is primarily a complex developmental lung abnormality with anomalous venous return. The most common features are lung hypoplasia, anomalous pulmonary venous return to IVC, pulmonary artery hypoplasia, bronchial anomalies and systemic arterial supply to hypoplastic lung. It almost always occurs on the right side and is slightly more common in women. One constant component of this syndrome is an anomalous pulmonary vein or veins draining at least a part or the entire affected lung most commonly to the inferior vena cava just above or below the diaphragm. Uncommonly, the anomalous vein may drain into hepatic, portal, azygos veins; the coronary sinus; or the right atrium. A scimitar vein is a vertical curvilinear opacity in the right mid-lower lung, running along the right heart border inferomedially towards the diaphragm to join the IVC. A scimitar vein present on a frontal chest radiograph is called the scimitar sign",

      answer: "Flow characteristic at the aneurysm neck",
      explanation: "An aneurysm occurs when a vessel diameter exceeds 1.5 times its normal size. In the abdomen this corresponds to 3 cm. These aneurysms should be repaired when the diameter exceeds 5–5.5 cm or the aneurysm expands more than 1 cm per year. The greatest benefit of 3D volume-rendered imaging is the depiction and precise measurement of angulation in aneurysms with marked tortuosity. The proximal landing zone consists of the region from the inferior-most renal artery to the beginning of the aneurysm. The maximal acceptable neck diameter is 32 mm. The length of the neck should be at least 15 mm (although one device allows a 7 mm neck). The angle between the superior portion of the aneurysm neck and the suprarenal aorta is preferably less than 60°. Study results suggest higher complications for aneurysms larger than 5.5–6.5 cm. The shape can be described as saccular or fusiform. The residual lumen through the aneurysm should measure approximately 18 mm to allow passage and proper deployment of the device. The preferred distal landing zone is the common iliac artery. Evaluation is similar to that of the proximal neck with assessment of diameter, length, tortuosity and degree of calcification and thrombus. The common iliac artery diameter should not be larger than 25 mm, and at least 10 mm of length is required for an adequate seal",

A convex posterior border of the vertebral body is more frequent in metastatic compression fractures than acute osteoporotic compression fractures. A higher frequency of abnormal signal intensity of the pedicle or posterior element has been observed in metastatic compression fractures. Epidural soft-tissue mass is suggestive of malignant vertebral collapse. A paraspinal mass is not helpful in differentiation of the cause of vertebral collapse but is more commonly encountered in the setting of metastatic compression, where it is typically focal rather than diffuse. Signal intensity abnormalities in the marrow of vertebrae other than the collapsed vertebrae are more frequently seen in metastatic compression fractures than acute osteoporotic compression fractures. Enhancement on post-contrast T1-weighted FS images is not useful in differentiation of acute osteoporotic fractures from malignant compression fracture, but it may be useful for old or chronic fractures, which will not show intense enhancement. Moreover, on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) vertebral metastases with compression fractures can be safely distinguished from vertebra with benign compression fractures based on significantly different ADC values",

      explanation: "In RFA, a high-frequency, alternating current with a wavelength of 460–500 kHz is emitted through an electrode placed within the targeted tissue. Grounding pads applied to the patient’s thighs complete the electrical circuit. Cell death starts at 49 degrees. Temperature above 60 degrees causes immediate cell death, and tissue charring occurs at 105 degrees. Cell death is induced by the denaturation of proteins. For percutaneous imaging-guided RFA, the energy is delivered into the target tissue by means of needle-like electrodes. Unlike in a typical biopsy, the electrode tip should be advanced to the deep margin of the tumour. On follow-up CT, ablated tumours often have internal areas of increased attenuation or increased signal intensity at CT and MRI. Areas of contrast enhancement (>10 HU or >15% with CT and MRI, respectively) are indicative of residual viable RCC. Residual viable tumour can be treated with additional ablation sessions. Heat-sink phenomena refers to the reduction in tissue temperature due to the conductive effects of adjacent vessels or airways. It is an explanation for distortion of the ablation zone and poor outcome in larger lesions. The heat-sink effect can be overcome by pharmacologically reducing blood flow, intra-arterial embolisation, intravascular balloon occlusion, Pringle manoeuvre or reducing treatment zone",

TACE provides a survival benefit in primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) based on randomised controlled studies. The normal parenchyma of the liver receives two-thirds of its necessary blood supply from the portal vein and the remaining one-third from the hepatic artery. However, it is well known that vascularisation of HCC is mostly dependent on the hepatic artery. TACE is not done for patients with a severely compromised liver function such as Child–Pugh classification C or late B. Though superselective TACE may be attempted in a patient with compromised liver function, if the patient has a diffuse or massive HCC or an HCC involving the major portal veins, this precludes the practice of safe TACE. The underlying factors associated with increased procedural complication include compromised liver function, main portal vein obstruction, biliary tract obstruction and a previous history of bile duct surgery",

      answer: "It depends on the histology of the tumour being treated",
      explanation: "The most common complication of TACE is post-embolisation syndrome, which consists of transient abdominal pain and fever occurring in 60%–80% of patients after TACE. Elevation of the level of hepatic transaminases typically accompanies post-embolisation syndrome. Whether post-embolisation syndrome reflects damage to the normal liver parenchyma or tumour necrosis is uncertain. Though prolonged hospitalisation may be required to monitor a patient and to control abdominal pain, vomiting and/or malaise, post-embolisation syndrome is self-limiting within 3–4 days, and the use of antibiotics is not necessary to treat the fever. Hepatic failure after TACE is related to TACE-induced ischaemic damage to the non-tumorous liver tissue. Several risk factors have been identified, including portal vein obstruction, use of a high dose of anticancer drugs and Lipiodol, a high level of bilirubin, prolonged prothrombin time and advanced Child–Pugh class. Other TACE-related complications occur in less than 10% of treatment sessions and include ischaemic cholecystitis, hepatic abscesses and biliary strictures. Development of a liver abscess has been linked to previous intervention in the biliary system being prone to an ascending biliary infection. Upper gastrointestinal complications such as gastritis, ulceration and bleeding can occur by the regurgitation of embolic agents into the gastric arteries (anatomical variants), which should be recognised on pretreatment imaging",

      response: "",
      answer: "Diuretic administration reduces the time during which images can be obtained",
      explanation: "T2-weighted techniques were the first clinically relevant means of visualising the urinary tract with MRI. Static-fluid MR urography does not require the excretion of contrast material and is therefore useful for demonstrating the collecting system of an obstructed, poorly excreting kidney. Static-fluid MR urograms can be obtained in 1–2 seconds, which allows multiple images to be obtained sequentially in a short period of time and played as a cine loop. Cine MR urography is particularly helpful in confirming the existence of urinary tract stenosis. For patients with non-dilated systems, the use of hydration, diuretics or compression may enhance the quality of MR urography. In case of excretory MR urogram, a gadolinium-based contrast agent is administered intravenously, and the collecting systems are imaged during the excretory phase. Gadolinium shortens the T1 relaxation time of the urine, allowing the urine to initially appear bright on T1-weighted images. Diuretic administration can improve the quality of excretory MR urography by enhancing urine flow, resulting in dilution and uniform distribution of gadolinium-based contrast material throughout the urinary tract; it also expands the temporal window during which images can be obtained. The primary imaging sequence for excretory MR urography is the 3D gradient-echo sequence. Fat suppression enhances the conspicuity of the ureters and is recommended. Motion suppression is critical for MR urographic sequences, and breath-hold acquisitions have been shown to better demonstrate the pelvicaliceal systems compared with respiratory triggering. IV hydration is preferred to oral hydration because fluid-filled structures can interfere with imaging on T2 sequences. MR urography is more sensitive and specific for non-calculous urinary tract obstruction than unenhanced CT. CT is more sensitive for stone disease. MRU is also used for evaluation of congenital urinary tract anomalies and haematuria, whereas the role of MRU for screening patients at risk for urothelial malignancy has yet to be defined",

A dose of 2 mmol/L is the recognised concentration of Gd-DTPA; this can be achieved by adding 0.8 mL of neat Gd-DTPA to 100 mL of normal saline. An alternative method would be to inject 4 mL of Gd-DTPA into a 500-mL bag of normal saline to achieve the same 2 mmol/L concentration.

The benign form accounts for 60% of all sacrococcygeal teratomas. Benign teratomas are predominantly cystic; have attenuation similar to fluid on CT; and may include bone, fat and calcification. Cystic areas appear low on T1-weighted and high on T2-weighted MRI. Fatty tissue demonstrates high signal intensity on T1-weighted images, whereas calcification is depicted as a signal void. The coccyx is always involved, even in benign sacrococcygeal teratoma, and must be resected with the tumour. Malignant teratomas are more solid, and haemorrhage and necrosis are common. Approximately 50% of benign teratomas contain calcification, whereas it is seldom seen in malignant tumours. Malignant teratomas may metastasise. Anterior sacral meningocoele is a congenital abnormality that arises from herniation of the CSF-filled dura mater through a sacral foramen or a defect in the sacral bone.

      answer: "Fibroids with high T1 signal pretreatment respond better to UFE",
      explanation: "UFE is a minimally invasive treatment for uterine fibroids. MRI should be used to evaluate patients before and after UFE to accurately assess fibroid location within the uterus fibroid number and size, and the presence or absence of fibroid enhancement on contrast material–enhanced images. Absolute contraindications include pregnancy, known or suspected gynaecologic malignancy, and current uterine or adnexal infection; relative contraindications include contrast material allergy, coagulopathy and renal failure. Pedunculated subserosal fibroids with a narrow stalk (<2–3 cm) are a relative contraindication to UFE because of the potential risk of detachment. Cervical fibroids tend to respond less favourably. The maximum size threshold for embolisation is 13–15 cm. Above this, the post-embolisation volume may still result in bulk symptoms, and the necrosis from a large fibroid may result in a protracted post-embolisation syndrome. Fibroids with increased cellular content and degenerate fibroids may demonstrate a high signal on T2-weighted MRI; however, a heterogeneous or markedly hyperintense T2 signal suggests degeneration. Completely hyalinised fibroids have low T2. T1 hyperintensity pre-MRI suggests fatty or haemorrhagic/red degeneration and is a negative predictor of success with a lower reduction in vascularity compared to fibroids with a low T1 signal. After successful embolisation, fibroids may undergo progressive liquefaction with increasing T2 signal. Volume reduction is greater in T2 hyperintense fibroids and hypervascular fibroids compared to hypovascular ones. Persistent enhancement post-embolisation is sign of incomplete fibroid infarction. An increase in signal on T1-weighted images is typically observed immediately after embolisation",

The ease with which this tumour invades the liver and surrounding structures, including the biliary tree, contributes to its high mortality. The median survival is 6 months, indicating that the majority of patients present with advanced disease. Epidemiologic studies have shown that female sex, age, postmenopausal status and cigarette smoking are risk factors. Ethnic origin, increased body mass and physician-diagnosed typhoid are risk factors in the high-incidence populations of La Paz, Bolivia, and Mexico City, Mexico. Exposure to chemicals used in the rubber, automobile, wood finishing and metal fabricating industries has been associated with an increased risk of gallbladder carcinoma. Cholelithiasis is a well-established risk factor for the development of gallbladder carcinoma, and gallstones are present in 74%–92% of affected patients. Gallstones cause chronic irritation and inflammation of the gallbladder, which leads to mucosal dysplasia and subsequent carcinoma. Porcelain gallbladder is an uncommon condition in which there is diffuse calcification of the gallbladder wall, and 10%–25% of patients with this condition have gallbladder carcinoma. Several pathologic and congenital anatomic anomalies are associated with a higher prevalence of gallbladder carcinoma, compared with that in the general population. These conditions include congenital cystic dilatation of the biliary tree, choledochal cyst, anomalous junction of the pancreaticobiliary ducts (with or without a coexistent choledochal cyst) and low insertion of the cystic duct.

      answer: "Ovarian dysfunction after UAE is more common in women under 45 years",
      explanation: "MRI with contrast is required to delineate uterine and ovarian artery anatomy prior to treatment. In most cases, bilateral UAE is needed, because most uterine fibroids, whether single or multiple, receive blood supply from both uterine arteries. Women over 45 years of age have been shown to have a higher prevalence of uterine–ovarian arterial anastomoses and are at increased risk for ovarian dysfunction after UAE Although infrequent, major adverse events can occur and include ovarian failure or amenorrhea, fibroid expulsion and rarely venous thromboembolism. Intracavitary fibroids are more likely to be expelled. Ischaemia leading to uterine necrosis, arterial dissection, endometritis and fibroid infarction are other complications. On MRI, endometritis may manifest as uterine enlargement with T1 hyperintense intracavitary haematoma; gas appears as a signal void on all sequences. Contrast enhancement may increase the conspicuity of intracavitary fluid collections. Embolic agents used for fibroids include PVA (300–350 microns) or embospheres, whereas agents used for post-partum haemorrhage are gel foam particles, coils (occasionally) or n-butyl-cyanoacrylate (glue)",

      answer: "Inability to identify T4 tumour",
      explanation: "In the setting of primary rectal cancer, MRI is used to assist in staging, in identifying patients who may benefit from preoperative chemotherapy–radiation therapy, and in surgical planning. Currently, surgical resection with stage-appropriate neoadjuvant combined-modality therapy is the mainstay in the treatment of rectal cancer. In the past decade, the increasingly widespread adoption of total mesorectal excision (TME) has resulted in a dramatic decline in the prevalence of local recurrence from 38% to less than 10%. TME is a surgical technique that entails en bloc resection of the primary tumour and the mesorectum by means of dissection along the mesorectal fascial plane or the circumferential resection margin (CRM). The evolution of surgical techniques and the shift to neoadjuvant chemotherapy–radiation therapy, along with the prognostic heterogeneity of stage T3 tumours, necessitate accurate preoperative staging – primarily in terms of tumour (T) and nodal (N) staging, depth of tumour invasion outside the muscularis propria (early versus advanced stage T3 tumours) and the relationship of the tumour to the potential CRM. Accurate assessment of these factors allows the triage of patients to up-front surgical resection or short- or long-course preoperative radiation therapy or chemotherapy–radiation therapy with appropriate modification of the CRM. Recent studies have shown that high-resolution MRI is a reliable and reproducible technique with high specificity (92%) for predicting a negative CRM, the relationship of the tumour to the CRM and the depth of tumour invasion outside the muscularis propria",

Occasionally, reflex sympathetic dystrophy may manifest as a focal abnormality limited to, for example, the hand or knee. Decreased radiotracer accumulation has also been described, especially in children. Three-phase bone scanning has an accuracy of over 90% and is the radionuclide procedure of choice for diagnosing osteomyelitis in bone not affected by underlying conditions. The first (dynamic) phase reflects the relative amount of blood flow to the area of interest, whereas the second (blood pool) phase reflects the amount of activity that has extravasated into the tissues around the area of interest. The third (delayed [bone]) phase reflects the rate of bone turnover. The classic appearance of osteomyelitis on three-phase bone scans consists of focal hyperperfusion, focal hyperaemia and focally increased bone uptake. Abnormalities at radionuclide bone imaging reflect increased bone mineral turnover in general, not infection specifically. Therefore, conditions associated with increased bone mineral turnover (e.g., tumours, fractures, joint neuropathy) may mimic osteomyelitis at three-phase bone scintigraphy. Under these circumstances, three-phase bone imaging is less useful, primarily because of diminished specificity",

With T2-weighted sequences, the lesion is typically characterised by an area of mixed signal intensity, with a central reticulated core and a peripheral rim of decreased signal intensity related to deposition of hemosiderin. Diffuse axonal injury shows multifocal microbleeds as low signal on GRE or SWI sequences. AVM are identified by serpiginous filling defects with large draining veins and feeding arteries. Haematomas will have mixed signal and will have surrounding oedema and mass effect, unless they are very small",

      response: "",
      answer: "Reversal of diastolic flow is specific for renal vein thrombosis",
      explanation: "Acute tubular necrosis is the most common cause of ‘delayed graft function’, whereas chronic rejection is the most common cause of late graft loss. US findings of diminished renal function include renal enlargement, increased cortical thickness, increased or decreased echogenicity of the renal cortex, loss of corticomedullary differentiation, prominent pyramids, collecting system thickening and effacement of the central sinus echo complex. Elevated resistive index (>0.8) is a non-specific parameter of renal transplant dysfunction; reversal of diastolic flow may also be seen. Renal artery stenosis is the most common vascular complication of transplantation. Doppler criteria include (1) velocities of greater than 2 m/sec, (2) a velocity gradient between stenotic and prestenotic segments of more than 2:1 and (3) marked distal turbulence. Although reversal of diastolic flow is non-specific, the combination with absent venous flow is virtually diagnostic of renal vein thrombosis. Renal artery thrombosis is diagnosed by lack of intrarenal venous and arterial flow. Renal vein stenosis results in three- to fourfold increase in flow velocity. Intrarenal arteriovenous fistulas and pseudoaneurysms are the result of vascular trauma during percutaneous biopsy. Extrarenal arteriovenous fistulas and pseudoaneurysms are extremely uncommon. They typically occur as a result of surgical technique rather than percutaneous biopsy. Small crescentic peritransplant fluid collections seen immediately after transplantation are most likely haematomas or seromas and are not significant. More complex collections identified later in the post-operative period with clinical evidence of infection may represent abscesses. Although the appearance of urinomas is non-specific, internal septations are seen less often than in haematomas. Lymphocele results in a rounded collection along the mid-ureter, associated with hydronephrosis",

      answer: "All of the above",
      explanation: "High-spatial-resolution MRI has already been established as an accurate tool for the preoperative staging of rectal cancer and has resulted in marked improvements in staging accuracy compared with historic studies. MRI also defines the relationship between a tumour and the mesorectal fascia, which denotes the CRM at TME. The potential CRM is considered involved if the tumour extends to within 1 mm of this fascia. Patients with locally advanced T3 or T4 disease or disease involving the potential CRM on baseline MRI are offered chemoradiation therapy (CRT). This approach has been shown to decrease the post-operative tumour recurrence rate. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Rectal Cancer European Equivalence (MERCURY) study evaluated consecutive patients undergoing both primary surgery and preoperative therapy with histopathologic correlation and analysed survival outcomes. The results of the study showed that post-CRT MRI assessment of tumour regression grade correlated with disease-free survival and overall survival and, thus, with patient prognosis. Furthermore, post-treatment MRI prediction of potential CRM involvement also gave prognostic information regarding the risk of local recurrence",

Case reports have suggested that restricted diffusion may be seen earlier than the classic T2 changes. It has been noted that myelinolysis can occur outside the pons, a condition that is referred to as extrapontine myelinolysis. Sites of extrapontine myelinolysis include the basal ganglia and cerebral white matter and, less commonly, the peripheral cortex, hippocampi and lateral geniculate bodies.

CT features of active Crohn’s disease include mucosal hyperenhancement, wall thickening (thickness >3 mm), mural stratification with a prominent vasa recta (comb sign) and mesenteric fat stranding, all of which are exquisitely demonstrated at CT enterography. The capability of CT enterography for depicting extra-enteric disease allows the simultaneous diagnosis of complications associated with Crohn’s disease, such as obstruction, sinus tract, fistula and abscess formation. Mural enhancement is the most sensitive indicator of active Crohn’s disease. Care should be taken to compare bowel loops with similar distention, since both the jejunum and normal collapsed loops may demonstrate regions of higher attenuation simulating enhancement. Inadequately distended bowel loops may be difficult to assess, and secondary signs of active disease, such as mesenteric fat stranding, vasa recta prominence or complications such as fistulas and abscesses should be sought to maximise the accuracy of a diagnosis of active disease. Prominence of the vasa recta adjacent to the inflamed loop of bowel (comb sign), along with increased mesenteric fat attenuation, is the most specific CT feature of active Crohn’s disease.

An isolated aneurysm smaller than 2 cm is unlikely to rupture. Rupture of RAAs is unlikely in most patients. Although some consider calcification to be protective of rupture, no correlation between calcification and risk of rupture is evident. Rupture has historically been associated with a high death rate, especially during pregnancy, and pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of aneurysm rupture. In non-pregnant patients, RAA rupture is likely to be associated with death in less than 10% of cases.
