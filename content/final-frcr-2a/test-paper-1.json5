    "stem": "A 30-year-old man has been involved in an Road Traﬃc Accident (RTA). Aortic injury is suspected. CT angiogram shows a fusiform dilatation at the anteromedial aspect of the aortic isthmus with a steep contour superiorly, gently merging with the proximal descending thoracic aorta inferiorly. What is the likely diagnosis?",

    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Ductus diverticulum",
    "explanation": "Ductus diverticulum is a focal bulge at the anteromedial aspect of the aortic isthmus, visualised in 9% of adults. It is critical to identify this normal variant and distinguish it from a post-traumatic false aneurysm, which also occurs most commonly at the aortic isthmus (88%). The classic ductus diverticulum has smooth, uninterrupted margins and gently sloping symmetric shoulders; in contrast, false aneurysms have a variety of shapes and sizes with sharp margins and often contain linear defects. Compared with the classic ductus diverticulum, the atypical ductus diverticulum has a shorter and steeper slope superiorly and a more classic gentle slope inferiorly. However, both shoulders have smooth, uninterrupted margins, an important feature that distinguishes this variant from true injury. Other normal variants that can mimic injury include aortic spindle, which is a smooth circumferential bulge immediately distal to the aortic isthmus; infundibulum at the origin of aortic branches like the brachiocephalic and intercostal arteries, which are spherical or conical in shape but have a vessel at its apex, thereby differentiating them from false aneurysms",

    "answer": "Candida oesophagitis",
    "explanation": "Candida oesophagitis occurs in patients whose normal flora is altered by broad spectrum antibiotic therapy and in patients whose immune systems are suppressed by malignancy, immunosuppressive agents like chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and immunodeficiency states such as AIDS. When the disease is superficial, the oesophageal mucosa may appear normal radiographically. Early in the course of Candida oesophagitis, mucosal plaques are the most frequent finding. Later erosions and ulcerations may develop, which together with intramural haemorrhage and necrosis result in the ‘shaggy’ margin seen on esophagograms",

Recent years have seen substantial progress in developing newer MRI methodologies for microbleed detection. Hemosiderin deposits in microbleeds are super-paramagnetic and thus have considerable internal magnetisation when brought into the magnetic field of MRI, a property defined as magnetic susceptibility. Among available pulse sequences, T2*-weighted GRE MRI is most sensitive to the susceptibility effect",

    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Anomalous anconeus epitrochlearis muscle results in PIN entrapment",
    "explanation": "Cubital tunnel syndrome is the most common entrapment neuropathy of the elbow. It is seen in throwing sports, tennis and volleyball. Traction injuries to the ulnar nerve can occur secondary to the dynamic valgus forces. Compression of the ulnar nerve within the cubital tunnel occur secondary to direct trauma, repetitive stresses, or replacement of the overlying retinaculum with an anomalous anconeus epitrochlearis muscle. Recurrent subluxation of the nerve due to acquired laxity from repetitive stress or trauma can lead to friction neuritis. Finally, osseous spurring within the ulnar groove caused by overuse and posteromedial impingement in throwers can cause nerve irritation. Ulnar nerve thickening and increased T2-weighted signal are typical MRI features. Radial nerve entrapment at the elbow can be subdivided into two major categories: radial tunnel syndrome and posterior interosseous nerve syndrome. The posterior interosseous nerve is a deep branch of the radial nerve in the forearm that can be compressed from repetitive gripping combined with supination in weightlifters and swimmers. The superficial head of the supinator muscle along the arcade of Frohse is the most common site of nerve entrapment. It is important to note that a small percentage of radial neuropathy cases can be associated with tennis elbow. MRI manifestations of PIN includes thickening and increased T2-weighted signal of the nerve fibres, as well as oedema-like signal changes in the innervated extensor compartment musculature in the acute and subacute setting and atrophy in the chronic stages",

    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy",
    "explanation": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is defined as a diffuse or segmental left-ventricular hypertrophy with a non-dilated and hyperdynamic chamber, in the absence of another cardiac or systemic disease explaining the degree of cardiac muscle hypertrophy. Dyspnoea on exertion is the most common symptom because the key functional hallmark of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an impaired diastolic function with impaired LV filling in the presence of preserved systolic function. Systolic dysfunction occurs at end-stage disease. Asymmetric involvement of the interventricular septum is the most common form of the disease, accounting for an estimated 60%–70% of the cases of HCM. Other variants include apical, symmetric, midventricular, mass-like and non-contiguous HCM is typically associated with hypertrophy of the muscle to 15 mm or thicker and a ratio of thickened myocardium to normal left-ventricular basal myocardium of 1.3–1.5. With MRI and multidetector computed tomography (CT), apical HCM has a characteristic spadelike configuration of the LV cavity at end diastole, appreciated on vertical long-axis views",

    "explanation": "Oesophageal intramural pseudodiverticulosis is a condition of unknown cause characterised by flask-shaped outpouchings of the mucosa that extend into the muscular layer and show characteristic findings on oesophagograms. They are dilated excretory ducts of deep oesophageal mucous glands resulting from obstruction of excretory ducts by plugs of viscous mucus and desquamated cells or by extrinsic compression of the ducts by periductal inflammatory infiltrates and fibrotic tissue. It occurs in all age groups predominantly in the sixth and seventh decades with slight male preponderance. It has been reported as a separate entity or in association with diseases such as diabetes, peptic strictures and oesophagitis",

    "response": "",
    "answer": "Endometriosis",
    "explanation": "Endometriosis is a common multifocal gynaecologic disease that manifests during the reproductive years, often causing chronic pelvic pain and infertility. The ovaries are among the most common sites (20%–40% of cases). It manifests either as superficial fibrotic implants or as chronic retention cysts with cyclic bleeding (endometriomas). Endometriomas are thick-walled cysts with a dark, dense content that represents degenerated blood products. The cysts may be solitary or multiple, and they are bilateral in 50% of cases. Endometriomas may include peripheral nodules (blood clots) or fluid–fluid levels; in the latter, the non-dependent portion represents the freshest bleeding. A multilocular-appearing endometrioma may consist of multiple contiguous cysts. Endometriomas are a marker of severity of deeply infiltrating endometriosis. On MRIs, cystic cavities can appear as simple fluid, with high signal intensity on T2-weighted and low signal intensity on T1-weighted images. They also may show high signal intensity on T1-weighted and T1-weighted fat-saturated images because of their haemorrhagic content. The shading sign, a common and unique feature of endometriomas, represents old blood products, which contain extremely high iron and protein concentrations. These haemorrhagic cysts typically show high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. However, endometriomas also may show variable signal intensity on T2-weighted images",

    "explanation": "The clinical history along with the radiographic findings points towards acromegaly, and in this case evaluating the pituitary gland for the presence of an adenoma along with correlating biochemistry blood profile would be appropriate investigations. Osseous enlargement of the vertebrae with increased AP diameter can occur with premature loss of disc space. Expansion of the terminal phalangeal tufts and metacarpals contribute to the clinical finding of ‘spadelike hands’. Other features include increased heel pad thickness >25 mm, premature OA, posterior vertebral scalloping, prognathism (elongated mandible), sellar enlargement and enlarged paranasal sinuses, mostly frontal sinus.

On imaging, multiple cortical–subcortical haematomas are recognised. Prominence of the ventricular system and enlargement of the sulci representing generalised cerebral and cerebellar atrophy are non-speciﬁc imaging ﬁndings.

They are commonly seen in the proximal femur or proximal humerus. They are solitary intramedullary lesions, centred at the metaphyses, adjacent to the epiphyseal cartilage (during the active phase) and migrating into diaphysis with growth (during the latent phase). They do not cross the epiphyseal plate. On a radiograph, they appear as an oval radiolucency with a long axis parallel to the long axis of the host bone, a ﬁne sclerotic boundary and scalloping of the internal aspect of the underlying cortex. SBC appears as a photopenic area on a bone scan (if not fractured). Classic ‘fallen fragment’ sign if fractured (20%); centrally dislodged fragment falls into a dependent position",

    "response": "",
    "answer": "Ménétrier’s disease",
    "explanation": "The hallmark of Ménétrier’s disease is gastric mucosal hypertrophy, which may cause the rugae to resemble convolutions of the brain. The thickening of the rugae is predominantly caused by expansion of the epithelial cell compartment of the gastric mucosa. Patients with Ménétrier’s disease most often present with epigastric pain and hypoalbuminemia secondary to a loss of albumin into the gastric lumen. Signs and symptoms of Ménétrier’s disease include anorexia, asthenia, weight loss, nausea, gastrointestinal bleeding, diarrhoea, oedema and vomiting. The disease has a bimodal age distribution. The childhood form is often linked to cytomegalovirus infection and usually resolves spontaneously. It usually occurs in children younger than 10 years (mean age 5.5 years), predominantly in boys (male-to-female ratio 3:1). The second peak occurs in adulthood, and the disease in adults tends to progress over time. The average age at diagnosis is 55, and men are aﬀected more often than women. A diagnosis of Ménétrier’s disease is made by using a combination of upper gastrointestinal ﬂuoroscopic imaging, endoscopic imaging and histologic analysis. On ﬂuoroscopic images, Ménétrier’s disease is characterised by the presence of giant rugal folds. Rugal folds should normally measure less than 1 cm in width across the fundus and 0.5 cm across the antrum, and they should be parallel to the long axis of the stomach",

      "Thickening of the LV wall measuring 14 mm with normal systolic function",
      "Thickened LV with delayed hyperenhancement of midwall"
    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Thickening of the entire LV wall measuring 17 mm at end diastole",
    "explanation": "HCM should be diﬀerentiated from other causes of symmetric increased thickness of the LV wall, including athlete’s heart, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, Fabry disease and adaptive LV hypertrophy due to hypertension or aortic stenosis. HCM is associated with hypertrophy of the muscle to 15 mm or thicker. In cardiac amyloidosis, the amyloid protein is deposited in the myocardium, which leads to diastolic dysfunction and restrictive cardiomyopathy. Because amyloidosis is a systemic process, involvement of all four chambers is common; thus, an increase in the thickness of the interatrial septum and right atrial free wall by more than 6 mm is seen. Dynamic enhanced MRI shows late enhancement over the entire subendocardial circumference. Sarcoidosis is a non-caseating granulomatous disease that inﬁltrates any area of the body, but most of the morbidity/mortality is from involvement of the heart. MRI shows nodular or patchy increased signal intensity on both T2-weighted and enhanced images, which often involves the septum (more particularly, the basal portion) and the LV wall, whereas papillary and right-ventricular inﬁltration are rarely seen. Fabry disease is a rare X-linked autosomal recessive metabolic storage disorder. At MRI, the LV wall is seen to be concentrically thickened, and delayed hyperenhancement is typically seen mid-wall and has been reported in the basal inferolateral segment. Diﬀerentiation between compensatory hypertrophy and HCM is sometimes diﬃcult. In comparison to HCM, patients with compensatory hypertrophy usually have normal systolic function, rather than hyperdynamic systolic function in HCM, and their LV wall rarely exceeds 15 mm in maximal thickness. Athlete’s heart can show increased LV wall thickness but end diastolic volume and ejection fraction are normal. Another feature of the cardiac remodelling in athletes is the lack of areas of delayed hyperenhancement within the LV myocardium at dynamic enhanced MRI",

    "explanation": "Amyloid arthropathy most typically aﬀects the shoulders, carpal bones and hips in a bilateral fashion. It is typically associated with long-term renal dialysis, which results in deposition of the beta-2 microglobulin. Aﬀected joints demonstrate subchondral cystic lesions with juxta-articular swelling. The presence of low-to-intermediate signal soft tissue within and around the joint clinches the diagnosis, as this represents the signal characteristics of the deposited proteins (cf. other inﬂammatory/infectious arthropathies, which tend to produce higher water content than soft-tissue changes in the joint). Joint space is also typically preserved until the late stages of disease, similar to gout",

    "response": "",
    "answer": "‘Black hole’ appearance",
    "explanation": "MS lesions can occur anywhere in the central nervous system but are most common in the periventricular white matter. Typical lesions are ovoid, with the long axis perpendicular to the ventricles. They are better seen on PD and FLAIR than on T2-weighted images because of increased lesion–CSF contrast. Lesions of the corpus callosum, at callososeptal interface and subcallosal striations are characteristic. FLAIR is less sensitive than T2-weighted images to infratentorial lesions occurring in the brain stem and middle cerebellar peduncles. In the acute phase, lesions show increase in size and solid or ring enhancement with IV contrast, which can persist up to 3 months, but generally resolve in weeks. Large acute lesions, with associated oedema, mass eﬀect and incomplete ring enhancement can mimic glioma (tumefactive MS). MS lesions show reduced magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR), reﬂecting decreased myelin content. MTR is also reduced in normal-looking white matter, representing occult tissue damage. Such occult tissue damage is also detected by diﬀusion tensor imaging, showing reduced fractional anisotropy. Low-signal lesions on T1-weighted MRI (black holes), brain and spinal cord atrophy are seen in established MS",

    "explanation": "Diagnosis of SUFE (slipped upper femoral epiphysis) is made using anteroposterior (AP) pelvis and lateral frog-leg radiographs. CT is rarely needed, although it is very sensitive. MRI depicts the slippage earliest, and MRI can demonstrate early marrow oedema and slippage. It is also useful in identifying pre-slip changes in the opposite hip and shows diﬀerentials, for example, infection, tumour, synovitis and so on. Although some institutions obtain a frog-leg lateral view, it is possible to further displace an acute or acute-on-chronic slip when the hips are placed in this position. Thus some institutions avoid them unless the request comes from an orthopaedic surgeon. Phraseology is important in all investigation-related questions; while the next investigation is frog-leg lateral in several/most places, the best investigation or the most appropriate examination would be MRI because it will provide the most information and cover all diﬀerentials",

Significant loss of white matter rather than grey matter is seen in the early stage of MS, suggesting a different mechanism of atrophy compared to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. MS lesions show reduced Magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR), reflecting decreased myelin content. MTR is also reduced in normal-looking white matter, representing occult tissue damage. MS lesions usually have a more reduced MTR as compared with ischaemic lesions in small vessel diseases.

It is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in childhood. The aetiology of KD remains unknown, although the clinical presentation – self-limiting illness manifested by an abrupt onset of fever, rash, exanthema, conjunctival injection and cervical adenopathy – and the epidemiological features – a seasonal peak in winter and spring, age distribution and a geographic wave-like spread of illness during epidemics – strongly suggest an infectious cause. Fever is usually the first sign of KD. Rash is non-specific and mostly maculopapular. Cervical lymphadenopathy is the last common of the main manifestations. Cardiovascular complications include coronary artery aneurysms, myocarditis, pericarditis with pericardial effusion, systemic arterial aneurysms, valvular disease, mild aortic root dilatation and myocardial infarct. Takayasu arteritis (TA), also known as pulseless disease, is a granulomatous large vessel vasculitis that predominantly affects the aorta and its major branches, with increased prevalence in Asian women <50 years of age. Churg–Strauss syndrome is a small-to-medium vessel necrotising pulmonary vasculitis, affecting patients in the third and fourth decades with asthma, eosinophilia and systemic symptoms like purpura and arthralgia. Moyamoya disease is an idiopathic, non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic, progressive vasculo-occlusive disease involving the circle of Willis, typically the supraclinoid internal carotid arteries. It has a bimodal age distribution, affecting children and adults. In children, ischaemic strokes are most pronounced, whereas in adults haemorrhage from the abnormal vessels is more common",

Other features include increased antral peristalsis and delayed gastric emptying. Infantile pyloric spasm also shows increased peristalsis and delayed gastric emptying with pyloric muscle thickness between 1.5 and 3 mm",

    "explanation": "The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis on MRI is based on signal intensity and enhancement changes as well as on morphologic abnormalities in the pancreatic parenchyma, pancreatic duct and biliary tract. The imaging features of chronic pancreatitis can be divided into early and late findings. Early findings include low-signal-intensity pancreas on T1-weighted fat-suppressed images, decreased and delayed enhancement after IV contrast administration, and dilated side branches. Late findings include parenchymal atrophy or enlargement, pseudocysts, and dilatation and beading of the pancreatic duct often with intraductal calcifications. Differentiating between an inflammatory mass due to chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma on the basis of imaging criteria remains difficult. Decreased T1 signal intensity with delayed enhancement after gadolinium administration as well as dilatation and obstruction of the pancreaticobiliary ducts can be seen in both diseases. Irregularity of the pancreatic duct, intraductal or parenchymal calcifications, diffuse pancreatic involvement, and normal or smoothly stenotic pancreatic duct penetrating through the mass ('duct penetrating sign') favour the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis over cancer. In distinction, a smoothly dilated pancreatic duct with an abrupt interruption, dilatation of both biliary and pancreatic ducts ('double-duct sign') and obliteration of the perivascular fat planes favour the diagnosis of cancer",

At US, the typical appearance is a homogeneous, hyperechoic mass with well-deﬁned margins and posterior acoustic enhancement. The CT ﬁndings consist of a hypoattenuating lesion on non-enhanced images. After intravenous administration of contrast material, arterial-phase CT shows early, peripheral, globular enhancement of the lesion. The attenuation of the peripheral nodules is equal to that of the adjacent aorta. Venous-phase CT shows centripetal enhancement that progresses to uniform ﬁlling. This enhancement persists on delayed-phase images. At MRI, haemangiomas are characterised by well-deﬁned margins and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, which is identical to that of cerebrospinal ﬂuid. Speciﬁcity is improved by using serial gadolinium-enhanced gradient-echo imaging. The gadolinium intake is similar to the intake of iodinated contrast material during enhanced CT. With T2-weighted spin-echo and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences, the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of MRI are 98% and the accuracy is 99%.

If the low-attenuation collection on CT displays a geometric margin, wood or organic FB should be suspected. The attenuation of wood changes over time as the water content changes, older wood being drier than fresh green wood",

CT and MRI is the mainstay of non-invasive diagnosis of Retroperitoneal fibrosis (RPF). CT allows comprehensive evaluation of the morphology, location and extent of RPF and involvement of adjacent organs and vascular structures. Moreover, abdominal CT allows detection of diseases often associated with idiopathic RPF (e.g., autoimmune pancreatitis) or demonstrating an underlying cause in cases of secondary RPF (e.g., malignancy). CT shows a well-defined mass, usually anterior and lateral to the aorta, sparing the posterior aspect and not causing aortic displacement. Idiopathic RPF typically has low signal intensity on T1-weighted images. The signal intensity on T2-weighted images is variable and reflects the degree of associated active inflammation (hypercellularity and oedema). After administration of contrast material, early soft-tissue enhancement mirrors the degree of inflammatory activity observed at T2-weighted imaging. The sensitivity of 18F-FDG PET is very high, which allows detection and quantification of the metabolic activity of retroperitoneal lesions. Although sensitivity is high, specificity is low and aortic wall in the elderly can show FDG uptake",

Widening of the interpediculate distance and alteration of the configuration of the pedicles are associated signs. Relatively large, slow-growing lesions that originate during a period of active skeletal growth (such as ependymomas) are most likely to give rise to posterior vertebral scalloping. Dural ectasia is thought to cause posterior vertebral scalloping due to loss of the normal protection provided to the vertebral body by a strong, intact dura. Dural ectasia classically occurs in association with inherited connective-tissue disorders such as Marfan syndrome (classical) and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome. Posterior vertebral scalloping is also commonly seen in patients with neurofibromatosis, most likely due to dural ectasia but also secondary to neurofibromas or a thoracic meningocoele. It has also been reported in patients with AS; in these cases, the development of associated arachnoid cysts may give rise to cauda equina syndrome. Acromegaly has been described as a further cause of diffuse posterior vertebral scalloping, probably because of a combination of soft-tissue hypertrophy in the spinal canal and increased bone resorption",

Diagnosis is typically by ophthalmologic examination, prompted by leukocoria or ‘white reflex’. Retinoblastoma appears as an echogenic soft-tissue mass with various degrees of calcification. The vascularity indicates tumour activity; that is, lesions are hypervascular at diagnosis and when active. Vascularity regresses with treatment. CT detects intra-ocular, extra-ocular and intracranial disease extension; excels at delineation of bony abnormalities; and readily depicts tumoural calcifications. On CT, retinoblastoma is characterised by an intermediate-density enhancing soft-tissue mass or masses, with varying degrees of calcification; calcification increases with therapeutic response. The vitreous may be abnormally dense from debris, haemorrhage, or increased globulin content. Retinoblastoma is a heterogeneously enhancing soft-tissue mass with various degrees of calcification on MRI. Lesions are typically hyperintense to vitreous on T1-weighted sequences and hypointense to vitreous on T2-weighted sequences. The vitreous may be abnormally bright on T1-weighted sequences because of increased globulin content and a decreased ratio of albumin to globulin that occurs with malignancy. The other choices are all differentials for white reflex, but do not show a solid mass with calcification",

    "explanation": "An important advance in stroke imaging is the development of CT perfusion imaging. CT angiography source images (CTA-SI) represent cerebral blood volume that is reduced in the core infarct and correlates with infarct volume as seen on DWI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging). CBF (cerebral blood flow), CBV (cerebral blood volume), and MTT (mean transit time) are three parameters that can distinguish infarcted tissue from potentially salvageable penumbra. Ischemic but non-infarcted tissue will have decreased CBF, elevated MTT, and normal or high CBV (mismatch). Once infarcted, there will also be a persistent decrease in CBV (matched defect). Sensitivity and specificity of DWI for stroke detection is very high. DWI bright signals do not necessarily represent irreversibly infarcted tissue but reflect redistribution of water from the extracellular to the intracellular space in ischaemic tissue. It is necessary to analyse maps of ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) to distinguish the effects of reduced water diffusibility (dark on ADC) from T2 ‘shine-through’ (bright on ADC). Both features lead to the DWI bright signals seen in ischaemia. The volumetric mismatch between the PWI and DWI volumes is a marker of potentially salvageable tissue at risk.

    "response": "",
    "answer": "Failure to identify pericardium on CT or MR is diagnostic",
    "explanation": "Congenital pericardial defects are uncommon. They range from small defects to complete absence of the pericardium. Both small pericardial defects and complete absence of the pericardium most often are left-sided. They can be recognised on plain chest radiographs because there is abnormal cardiac contour due to protrusion of all or part of the cardiac chamber, for example, the left atrial appendage, through the defect. Shift of the cardiac axis to the left and posteriorly is seen with complete absence or large pericardial defects. With CT or MRI, failure to visualise a portion of the pericardium does not necessarily indicate a pericardial defect, however, because the pericardium over the left atrium and ventricle may not always be visualised in normal subjects. Patients with pericardial defects also may have one or more associated congenital abnormalities, including atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, mitral valve stenosis, or TOF, which also are detectable on CT or MRI",

    "answer": "MR",
    "explanation": "Transthoracic echocardiography is not very accurate in the depiction of pericardial thickening. Transoesophageal imaging allows better visualisation of the pericardium, and Doppler techniques are particularly useful in the diagnosis; however, the transoesophageal approach has a narrow field of view and is invasive. Both CT and MRI demonstrate the pericardium very well. Normal pericardial thickness is less than 2 mm. Pericardial thickness of 4 mm or more indicates thickening and, when accompanied by features of heart failure, is suggestive of constrictive pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis and restrictive cardiomyopathy are differentiated on the basis of thickened pericardium. Pericardial thickening may be limited to the right side of the heart or an even smaller area, such as the right atrioventricular groove. An additional advantage of CT is its high sensitivity in depicting pericardial calcification. It is important to remember, however, that neither pericardial thickening nor calcification is diagnostic of constrictive pericarditis unless the patient also has symptoms of physiologic constriction or restriction. At both CT and MRI, the right ventricle tends to have a reduced volume and a narrow tubular configuration. In some patients, a sigmoid-shaped ventricular septum or prominent leftward convexity in the septum can be observed. Systemic venous dilatation particularly inferior vena cava (IVC), hepatomegaly and ascites also are frequently seen",

    "response": "",
    "answer": "Thoracic outlet syndrome",
    "explanation": "Thoracic outlet syndrome involves the brachial plexus and the subclavian artery or vein at three anatomic levels where they are vulnerable to entrapment; the interscalene space, the costoclavicular space and the retropectoralis minor space. Thoracic outlet syndrome may result from post-traumatic fibrosis of the scalene muscles, compression secondary to activities like backpacking, and clavicular fractures with callus formation and exercise-related muscle hypertrophy affecting weightlifters, swimmers, tennis players and so on. Other causes include mass lesions such as lipomas, neurogenic tumours, accessory muscles and fibrous bands. MRI can help identify specific muscle denervation patterns. Muscle oedema may occur within 24–48 hours. In contrast, fatty atrophy reflects chronic denervation and manifests several months later. In this setting, MRI has an advantage over electromyography, which does not demonstrate signs of muscle denervation until 2–3 weeks after nerve impairment. Radiographs may reveal a cervical rib or a prominent C7 transverse process. Narrowing has been reported in the costoclavicular and retropectoralis minor spaces during imaging with postural manoeuvres during dynamic MRI. Sagittal T1-weighted MRI sequences are particularly useful in demonstrating the presence of denervation-related fatty atrophy of muscles, effacement of fat planes around the compressed plexus and an abnormal intramuscular course of the components of the brachial plexus. The retropectoralis minor space is not frequently affected by entrapment and is more often involved by mass lesions",

With high-resolution CT, the pericardium may be visualised as a 1- to 2-mm band of soft-tissue attenuation. With T1-weighted MRI, the pericardium is a dark band bordered by high-intensity fat. The pericardial sac normally contains 15–30 mL of fluid lying between the parietal and visceral layers of the serous pericardium. The fibrous pericardium is anchored to the diaphragm by the pericardiophrenic ligament and the central tendons; the sternopericardial ligaments provide anterior attachment. The outer layer of the pericardium extends to and fuses with the root of the aorta, the right and left pulmonary arteries, the superior vena cava and the pulmonary veins.

On rare occasions, it may involve the peripancreatic region, omentum, retroperitoneum, or pelvis. Although the cause of sclerosing mesenteritis is unknown, the disorder is often associated with other idiopathic inflammatory disorders such as retroperitoneal fibrosis, sclerosing cholangitis, Riedel thyroiditis and orbital pseudotumour. The CT appearance of sclerosing mesenteritis can vary from subtle increased attenuation in the mesentery to a solid soft-tissue mass. Sclerosing mesenteritis most commonly appears as a soft-tissue mass in the small bowel mesentery, although infiltration of the region of the pancreas or porta hepatis is also possible. The mass may envelop the mesenteric vessels, and over time collateral vessels may develop. There may be preservation of fat around the mesenteric vessels, a phenomenon that is referred to as the fat ring sign.

The incidence increases with age and body mass and is also associated with chronic corticosteroid therapy. Patients are usually asymptomatic, but they may have arrhythmias or superior vena cava syndrome when the superior vena cava is encased. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum, in contrast to cardiac lipoma, does not have a capsule. Because lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum spares the fossa ovalis, it often has a dumbbell-shaped appearance. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum has the same density and signal intensity as fat on CT and MR, respectively. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum is hypointense on fat saturation sequences and does not enhance post-contrast",

MRI findings have been correlated with symptoms of diabetes insipidus, which is a clinical hallmark of the condition. Typically, the formation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis granulomas leads to a loss in the normally high signal intensity of the posterior neurohypophysis on T1-weighted images. Furthermore, the hypothalamus, the pituitary stalk or both are frequently enlarged and demonstrate gradually increasing homogeneous enhancement after an intravenous injection of gadolinium, without subsequent washout. The differential diagnosis includes other infundibular diseases, such as adenohypophysitis, which can be differentiated from Langerhans cell histiocytosis by a sharp increase in contrast enhancement and rapid washout after the administration of the intravenous contrast medium. Granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis, Wegener disease and leukaemia must also be considered in the differential. Rarer differentials are germ cell tumours (germinoma, teratoma) and haemangioblastoma. These produce the same MRI features, with the same pattern of enhancement at dynamic imaging. The second most frequent pattern of central nervous system involvement in Langerhans cell histiocytosis is characterised by intra-axial neuro-degenerative changes. Bilateral symmetric lesions in the cerebellum, especially the dentate nucleus, basal ganglia, or brainstem, are most often observed. The differential diagnosis includes ADEM, acute multiphasic disseminated encephalitis, disseminated encephalitis, various metabolic and degenerative disorders, leukoencephalopathy secondary to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and paraneoplastic encephalitis",

    "response": "",
    "answer": "Reduced diastolic flow is specific for acute rejection",
    "explanation": "Acute rejection is a cell-mediated reaction seen within 1–4 weeks. Doppler shows decreased diastolic flow, causing a high resistance index (>0.8) and low pulsatility index. However, it is a non-specific finding also seen with acute tubular necrosis, cyclosporine toxicity, acute pyelonephritis, obstruction, renal vein thrombosis and compression by perirenal collections. A high resistive index, more than 0.9, is relatively specific for acute rejection. Some centres use pulsatility index. A PI of more than 1.5 is used for diagnosing rejection. MRI shows increased cortical signal intensity and loss of corticomedullary differentiation on T1-weighted scans. Acute tubular necrosis is common in the early post-operative period and results in reduced function, which gradually recovers over the next few weeks to months. There is no graft tenderness or fever, unlike acute rejection. The scintigraphic findings are abnormal immediately after surgery. The perfusion phase is relatively maintained well; later phases show slow washout and persistent isotope accumulation. In contrast, if the isotope study is normal in the early post-operative phase and becomes abnormal subsequently, acute rejection can be diagnosed confidently. Thrombosis of the renal vein is rare and typically occurs in the early post-operative phase. The transplant appears swollen and hypoechoic on US. Doppler US shows the absence of flow in the veins and sharp systolic waves, with reversed diastolic flow. Resistivity index is markedly elevated. Cyclosporine is nephrotoxic and causes a dose-dependent reduction of renal function. The imaging findings are non-specific. The perfusion phase of the 99m Tc-DTPA study is normal, but there is prolonged clearance of 99 m Tc MAG3. Normal perfusion and delayed excretion are also seen in obstruction",

Studies have shown that these areas of microbleeding are not associated with a worse outcome, and guidelines state that the presence of fewer than five areas of microbleeding on initial MRIs does not contraindicate thrombolysis. Parenchymal haematoma is a rarer type of haemorrhagic transformation that results from vessel wall rupture caused by high reperfusion pressure.

MRI is also useful in the evaluation of foetal lung maturation through volume and signal intensity. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is the most commonly diagnosed lung malformation. In CCAM, abnormal branching of the immature bronchioles and lack of normal alveolar development results in a solid/cystic intrapulmonary mass. Most pulmonary sequestrations detected prenatally are extralobar, with an anomalous vein that drains into the systemic circulation. On T2-weighted images, they are seen as well-defined hyperintense masses with or without hypointense septa. Intralobar sequestration may be difficult to differentiate from CCAM. MRI is also useful for evaluating other pulmonary and thoracic anomalies. Bronchogenic cysts are identified as hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted sequences; they are usually single lesions, located in the lung or mediastinum. Oesophageal duplication cysts are also identified as hyperintense mediastinal lesions. Congenital lobar emphysema can be difficult to distinguish from intralobar sequestration and from CCAM.

    "response": "",
    "answer": "Scleroderma",
    "explanation": "Systemic sclerosis, or scleroderma, is characterised by excessive collagen production, autoimmune disease–induced inflammation, and microvascular injury. It is divided into two subtypes: limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis and diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis typically manifests as CREST syndrome, which stands for calcinosis cutis, Raynaud phenomenon, oesophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly and telangiectasia and is generally anticentromere–antibody positive. The systemic manifestations of systemic sclerosis are diverse. Abnormalities of the circulatory system (most notably Raynaud phenomenon) and involvement of multiple organ systems – such as the musculoskeletal, renal, pulmonary, cardiac and gastrointestinal systems – with fibrotic or vascular complications are most common. Nearly 90% of patients with systemic sclerosis have evidence of gastrointestinal involvement, which is, ultimately, a substantial cause of morbidity. The underlying pathologic change consists of smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis caused by collagen deposition primarily in the tunica muscularis. Oesophageal involvement typically affects the distal two-thirds of the oesophagus because of the lack of striated muscle in the upper one-third. Findings of oesophageal involvement include decreased or absent oesophageal peristalsis combined with prominent gastroesophageal reflux from an incompetent lower oesophageal sphincter. Oesophagitis is frequently present, and associated complications such as oesophageal stricture or Barrett metaplasia are fairly common. Small bowel findings include hypomotility from smooth muscle atrophy and fibrosis, which leads to stasis, dilatation and pseudo-obstruction. The ‘hide-bound’ sign of valvular packing is a fairly specific finding and may be seen in as many as 60% of patients with scleroderma",

There may be an ill-defined echogenic halo around the lesion, particularly the lateral margins, and distortion of the adjacent breast tissue, akin to spiculations, may be evident. Posterior acoustic shadowing is frequently observed, due to attenuation of the US beam by dense tissue.

    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Low signal on T1W MRI is seen >8 hours",
    "explanation": "A good rule of thumb is that if the signal intensity on ADC maps is low, the stroke is less than 1 week old. Most literature indicate that in patients with ischaemic stroke, findings on FLAIR images are positive 6–12 hours after onset of symptoms. Sometimes the presence of restricted diffusion with negative findings at FLAIR imaging alone has been enough to initiate treatment. High signal intensity is not usually seen at T2-weighted imaging until at least 8 hours after the initial ischaemic insult and continues into the chronic phase. Low signal intensity is not usually seen at T1-weighted imaging until 16 hours after the onset of stroke and persists into the chronic phase. The pattern of contrast enhancement may help determine the age of the stroke. In ischaemic stroke, enhancement may be arterial, meningeal, or parenchymal. Arterial enhancement, dubbed the ‘intravascular enhancement’ sign, usually occurs first and may be seen as early as 0–2 hours after the onset of stroke. Meningeal enhancement is the rarest type of enhancement. It occurs within the first week after onset of stroke. If parenchymal enhancement persists longer than 8–12 weeks, a diagnosis other than ischaemic stroke should be sought",

When blood from the umbilical vein reaches the left portal vein, it is directed to the ductus venosus, which originates from the left portal vein immediately opposite the insertion site of the umbilical vein and courses cephalad to the inferior vena cava. The preferred location of the tip of the umbilical venous catheter is typically in the cephalad portion of the inferior vena cava or at the inferior vena caval–right atrial junction.

    "response": "",
    "answer": "Primary cardiac lymphomas mostly affect the left side of the heart",
    "explanation": "Secondary malignancies involving the heart are 20–40 times more frequent than primary cardiac neoplasms. Angiosarcoma is the most common primary cardiac malignancy of adulthood. The tumour typically involves the right atrium, and so presenting symptoms are related to obstruction to right cardiac filling and pericardial tamponade. They are heterogeneously high signal on T1 and T2-weighted images with heterogeneous enhancement. Undifferentiated sarcoma mostly arises in the left atrium, although they can also involve the cardiac valve. It appears as an isointense irregular mass infiltrating the myocardium. Primary cardiac lymphomas are exceedingly rare, are typically of the non-Hodgkin B-cell type and are confined to the heart or pericardium. They most commonly involve the right side of the heart, in particular the right atrium, with frequent involvement of more than one chamber and invasion of the pericardium. At MRI, they are isointense on T1-weighted images and heterogeneously hyperintense on T2-weighted images; they demonstrate heterogeneous enhancement after administration of gadolinium contrast material. Rhabdomyosarcomas do not arise from any specific chamber, but they are more likely than any other primary cardiac sarcomas to involve the valves",

    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "There is caudate lobe atrophy in chronic Budd–Chiari",
    "explanation": "Budd–Chiari syndrome is a heterogeneous group of disorders characterised by hepatic venous outflow obstruction at the level of the hepatic veins, the IVC, or the right atrium. Budd–Chiari syndrome has variable imaging features. Hepatic vein or IVC thrombosis, with resultant changes in liver morphology and enhancement patterns, venous collaterals, varices, and ascites may be directly observed. Duplex Doppler US is a useful method for detecting Budd–Chiari syndrome because it allows easy assessment of hepatic venous flow and detection of hepatic parenchymal heterogeneity. CT and MR imaging also can depict hepatic venous flow or thrombosis and IVC compression or occlusion. In the presence of acute disease, the imaging features correspond with histologic findings of liver congestion and oedema. The liver is globally enlarged, with lower attenuation on CT images, decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted MRIs, and heterogeneously increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRIs, predominantly in the periphery. Differential contrast enhancement between the central and peripheral areas of liver parenchyma is a feature of acute Budd–Chiari syndrome. The more oedematous and congested peripheral regions demonstrate decreased contrast enhancement, whereas stronger enhancement is seen in the central parenchyma. After the administration of contrast material, increased enhancement is seen in areas of venous drainage that are less affected, such as the caudate lobe. The development of intra- and extrahepatic collateral veins in subacute Budd–Chiari syndrome permits the egress of venous flow, producing a more homogeneous enhancement pattern with persistent signs of oedema. In chronic Budd–Chiari syndrome, there is atrophy of the affected portions of the liver, and the parenchymal oedema is replaced by fibrosis, which results in decreased T1- and T2-weighted signal intensity at unenhanced MRI and in delayed enhancement in contrast-enhanced studies. Hypertrophy of the caudate lobe, irregularities of the liver contour, and regenerative nodules are prominent features of chronic Budd–Chiari syndrome",

Its classic diagnostic criterion was ‘3 or more consecutive wedged thoracic vertebrae’. However, the pathological changes also include disc and end plate lesions, primarily Schmorl node and irregular vertebral end plate. Therefore, the diagnosis of ‘atypical Scheuermann disease’ was proposed for patients with only one or two wedged vertebrae and no notable kyphosis but characteristic disc/end plate lesions. Because atypical Scheuermann disease tends to affect the lumbar or thoracolumbar junction region instead of the thoracic spine, it is also called lumbar Scheuermann disease",
