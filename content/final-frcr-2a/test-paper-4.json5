      answer: "Hyperintense on MR images acquired during the hepatobiliary phase after injection of hepatocyte-specific contrast agent",
      explanation: "At contrast-enhanced CT and MR imaging, infiltrative HCC may be difficult to discern from underlying heterogeneous cirrhosis because of its permeative appearance, its minimal and inconsistent arterial enhancement and the heterogeneous washout appearance that occurs during the venous phase. The enhancement pattern of infiltrative HCC seen on images obtained during the hepatic arterial phase has been reported as minimal, patchy or miliary. Although arterial hyperenhancement is a key diagnostic feature of nodular and massive HCC, infiltrative HCC may commonly appear as iso- or hypointense on images obtained during the arterial phase. Washout appearance is a specific CT and MR imaging feature of typical nodular HCC. Hypointensity relative to the surrounding liver parenchyma during the venous phase of enhancement remains a valid sign for the detection of infiltrative HCC. However, washout appearance of the tumour is usually reported as irregular and heterogeneous and is less frequently seen in infiltrative HCC than in other HCC subtypes. Moreover, a reticular appearance of the tumour has been seen on images obtained during the venous and equilibrium phases, possibly related to fibrosis. Finally, the tumour generally appears as hypointense on MR images acquired during the hepatobiliary phase after injection of hepatocyte-specific contrast agent because of the lack of contrast agent uptake",

The undescended testis may be positioned anywhere along the normal path of descent. The most common location is in the inguinal canal (72%), followed by prescrotal (20%). Simple testicular cysts are mostly found incidentally, non-palpable, in men above 40 years, located at the mediastinum testis. Testicular metastases are rare and a sign of advanced primary disease, mostly from the prostate (35%), lung (20%), melanoma, colon or kidney. They may appear discrete or diffusely infiltrate the parenchyma. Tubular ectasia of the rete testis is a benign condition resulting from partial or complete obliteration of the efferent ducts that cause ectasia of the rete testis.

      explanation: "The fallen fragment sign comprises a small fragment that lies in the dependant portion of a radiolucent skeletal lesion. It is mostly recognised in radiograph, but analogous findings can be seen on CT or MRI. A dependant bone fragment can result from a pathologic fracture through thin cortical wall of a simple bone cyst. After minor trauma periosteum and surrounding muscle prevents centrifugal displacement of fracture fragment. However, a fractured fragment can become dislodged and fall centrally. The fluid content of the lesion allows the fragment to drop to the dependant portion of the cyst",

      answer: "Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy",
      explanation: "The most common imaging manifestation of HIV infection is global atrophy that is out of proportion to age. The finding of diffuse cerebral atrophy can be accompanied by diffuse, confluent, ill-defined areas of abnormally increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI of the periventricular white matter. No enhancement is noted. The findings may be accompanied by encephalopathy (AIDS dementia complex). These global abnormalities were previously attributed to a subacute encephalitis caused by HIV. It now seems likely that both HIV and CMV can cause subacute encephalitis and encephalopathy; these conditions have an identical non-specific imaging appearance. CMV encephalopathy appears to manifest itself late in the illness, whereas HIV dementia (although usually presenting late) can occasionally be the AIDS-defining illness. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is the most serious focal lesion without significant mass effect. It is caused by the JC virus. On CT, the lesions have low attenuation. On MRI, they are of low signal intensity on TI-weighted images and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. They exhibit little or no mass effect. Although ring enhancement has been reported, these lesions generally do not enhance on CT or MRI. They often occur at the interface between the grey matter and the white matter and have a scalloped contour secondary to involvement of peripheral U-fibres. The parietal lobe is predominantly affected, but these lesions also occur in the periventricular white matter, posterior fossa, brainstem, spinal cord and even the basal ganglia",

      response: "",
      answer: "Oesophageal duplication cyst",
      explanation: "Oesophageal duplication cysts are rare congenital anomalies. They are associated with vertebral anomalies (spina bifida, hemivertebrae, fusion defects). There is also an association with oesophageal atresia and small bowel duplication. Most cysts develop in the right posteroinferior mediastinum. CT demonstrates a well-marginated round, oval or tubular-shaped fluid-filled cystic structure that has a well-defined, thin wall. The cyst is of water attenuation with no enhancement of contents and no infiltration of surrounding structures. Malignant degeneration is rare. Bronchogenic cyst is the most common cystic mediastinal mass that typically lies in the middle mediastinum, not in a paraspinal location; in addition, you would not expect an air–fluid level. Cystic teratoma is an anterior mediastinal mass. Morgagni hernia would be unlikely to cause a solitary round lesion; multiple structures would be expected",

The oedema may continue up to 6 months post-operative; however, in most lung transplant recipients, it has cleared completely by 2 months. The radiographic and HRCT features are non-specific and may include perihilar ground-glass opacities, peribronchial and perivascular thickening, and reticular interstitial or airspace opacities located predominantly in the middle and lower lung lobes. Acute rejection due to a cell-mediated immune response commonly occurs in the second week post-operative. HRCT features are also relatively non-specific and may include ground-glass opacities (often with basal distribution), peribronchial cuffing, septal thickening and pleural effusion",

Without its cartilage cover, the bony fragment may become dislodged into the joint. Common sites of involvement include the lateral aspect of the medial femoral condyle, followed by the talar dome (posteromedial more than anteromedial), anterolateral aspect of the capitellum and the tibial plafond. Rarer sites include navicular, femoral head, humeral head, glenoid and scaphoid. MRI Grading of OCD I. Marrow oedema (stable). II. Articular cartilage breached.

      answer: "Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome",
      explanation: "Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome also known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), is most commonly encountered in association with acute hypertension, preeclampsia or eclampsia, renal disease, sepsis and exposure to immunosuppressants. At CT or MR imaging, the brain typically demonstrates focal regions of symmetric hemispheric oedema. The parietal and occipital lobes are most commonly affected, followed by the frontal lobes, the inferior temporal–occipital junction and the cerebellum. Lesion confluence may develop as the extent of oedema increases. MR DWI was instrumental in establishing and consistently demonstrating that the areas of abnormality represent vasogenic oedema. The oedema usually completely reverses. Focal or patchy areas of PRES vasogenic oedema may also be seen in the basal ganglia, brainstem and deep white matter (external/internal capsule). When they accompany hemispheric or cerebellar PRES, it is easy to recognise these. Present in isolation or when the hemispheric pattern is incompletely expressed (partial/asymmetric), diagnosis of PRES can be challenging. If cerebellar or brainstem involvement are extensive, hydrocephalus and brainstem compression may occur. Focal areas of restricted diffusion (likely representing infarction or tissue injury with cytotoxic oedema) are uncommon (11%–26%) and may be associated with an adverse outcome. Haemorrhage (focal haematoma, isolated sulcal/subarachnoid blood or protein) is seen in approximately 15% of patients",

It is thought to be caused by focal arrest in foetal lung development before the seventh week of gestation. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation represents 25% of all congenital lung lesions. A CXR on Day 1 of life usually demonstrates dense lungs with increased volume on the affected side. On Day 2, a CXR usually demonstrates resorption of fluid from affected areas of lung, which are then replaced with air-containing spaces.

Various risk factors have been reported for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, and the radiologic and pathologic findings of this disease entity may differ depending on the underlying risk factors. Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma can be classified into three types on the basis of gross morphologic features: mass forming (the most common), periductal infiltrating and intraductal growth. At CT, mass-forming intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma usually appears as a homogeneous low-attenuation mass with irregular peripheral enhancement; it can be accompanied by capsular retraction, satellite nodules and peripheral intrahepatic duct dilatation. Periductal infiltrating cholangiocarcinoma is characterised by growth along the dilated or narrowed bile duct without mass formation. On CT and MRI, diffuse periductal thickening and increased enhancement can be seen with a dilated or irregularly narrowed intrahepatic duct. Intraductal cholangiocarcinoma may manifest with various imaging patterns, including diffuse and marked duct ectasia either with or without a grossly visible papillary mass, an intraductal polypoid mass within localised ductal dilatation, intraductal cast-like lesions within a mildly dilated duct and a focal stricture-like lesion with mild proximal ductal dilatation",

Enhancing parenchymal mass lesions are also commonly reported. These lesions may be mistaken for primary or metastatic tumour or tumefactive demyelination. Enhancing mass lesions are frequently associated with nearby leptomeningeal involvement. Leptomeningeal involvement is perhaps the most typical manifestation of central nervous system sarcoidosis, seen in about 40% of cases. This is usually seen as thickening and enhancement of the leptomeninges on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. The enhancement may be diffuse or nodular. Leptomeningeal involvement around the hypothalamus and pituitary infundibulum may be seen with basilar leptomeningeal involvement or as an isolated finding. Cranial nerve involvement is also described. Any cranial nerve can be affected, but the most common cranial nerve deficit involves the facial nerve (VII), whereas radiographically the optic nerves (II) are most commonly abnormal",

A clinico-pathological and radiological continuum has been reported since the earliest documented cases of PCP. At one end of the spectrum are children with a florid clinical course, who progress from health to death in days. They show marked hypoxia and rapid radiographic evolution of parahilar granular infiltrates to extensive bilateral airspace opacification. Pathologically, an extensive foamy alveolar exudate is seen. Conversely, there are those with an insidious presentation, less profound hypoxia and a slower recovery. These patients tend not to progress to alveolar opacification but show persistent bilateral granular or ground-glass opacification, representing relative prominence of interstitial pulmonary involvement",

      answer: "HCC is characteristically hyperechoic on ultrasound",
      explanation: "HCC does not have a characteristic appearance at US. The lesions are typically hypoechoic, but they can be hyperechoic or have mixed echogenicity. The majority of nodules that measure less than 1 cm are not HCC. Detected nodules that measure less than 1 cm should be rescanned at a 3-month interval with the modality by which the lesions were first identified. If the nodules remain stable for a 2-year period, regular 6-month follow-up examinations can be resumed for routine surveillance. The nodules that are suspicious for HCC are new nodules that measure more than 1 cm or nodules that enlarge over a time interval. These suspicious nodules require immediate further investigation with multiphasic CT or MRI. The radiologic diagnosis of HCC can be made at either CT or MR imaging, provided that a multiphasic contrast material–enhanced study is used. Characteristically, HCC enhances during the arterial phase because of its blood supply from abnormal hepatic arteries. Contrast medium in the surrounding liver parenchyma is diluted during this phase, because the parenchymal blood supply arises mostly from the portal veins, which are not yet opacified. In the portal venous phase, the surrounding liver parenchyma becomes relatively hyperattenuated and the lesion is perceived to be hypoattenuated because of its lack of portal venous supply. This appearance is the so-called washout effect. Occasionally, washout is evident only during a delayed-phase sequence. HCC differs from most malignancies because it is commonly diagnosed on the basis of imaging features alone, without histologic confirmation",

Although epidural mass was suggestive of metastatic fractures, a paraspinal mass is more commonly associated with metastatic compression fracture. Metastatic involvement of other vertebra is also more likely to suggest malignant compression fracture. Spared normal bone marrow signal intensity of the vertebral body is highly suggestive of acute osteoporotic compression fractures. Band-like low signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted images is more common in acute osteoporotic compression fractures than metastatic compression fractures.

Because its occurrence is so rare, the patient demographics cannot be accurately assessed. However, demographic data from case review studies indicate an age range of 25–58 years (average 43.5 years) and a slight female predominance (male to female ratio 2:3). Typical manifestations of HEH include non-focal abdominal pain, jaundice and hepatosplenomegaly, but HEH has also been discovered incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Budd–Chiari syndrome can develop if the tumour invades the hepatic veins. Alternating high- and low-signal-intensity rings on T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images have been characterised as a ‘target’ sign. The tumours typically exhibit central signal hypointensity on unenhanced T1-weighted images and a multilayered target-like appearance with prominent rim-like enhancement on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. The presence of capsular retraction in subcapsular hepatic tumours, along with a target-like appearance of the tumours on contrast-enhanced CT and MR images, is suggestive but not necessarily indicative of HEH. This constellation of findings can be found in peripheral cholangiocarcinoma, confluent foci of hepatic fibrosis (usually in the setting of advanced cirrhosis), previously treated primary or metastatic HCCs and large atypical cavernous haemangiomas. However, the absence of cirrhosis in a patient with multiple liver masses that coalesce over time to form larger masses, in combination with other characteristic imaging findings of HEH, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis",

A pie-in-the-sky bladder may be seen with pelvic trauma. The sign refers to the high position of the opacified bladder within the pelvis at imaging and implies the presence of a large pelvic haematoma; it should raise concern for an associated urethral injury. A linear filling defect within the bladder may result from extrusion of a blood clot from the ureter, which has acted as a mould, in gross haematuria.

The lunate should appear trapezoid and not triangular in shape (AP radiograph), which may indicate dislocation and rotation. On the lateral view, the distal radius, lunate and capitate should be in alignment. Volar loss of lunate alignment is seen in lunate dislocation, and dorsal loss of capitate alignment is seen in perilunate dislocation.

They are associated with other vascular malformations like cavernoma. On contrast-enhanced CT, the venous collector of the DVA is readily detectable as a linear or curvilinear focus of enhancement, typically coursing from the deep white matter to a cortical or a deep vein or to the dural sinus. On MRI, DVAs typically have a transhemispheric flow void, on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. The collector vein is detected as a linear or small, round, signal-void structure on all sequences and is shown most clearly on T2-weighted imaging. On contrast-enhanced MRI, the cluster of veins in DVAs has a spoked wheel appearance; the veins are small at the periphery and gradually enlarge as they approach a central draining vein. This appearance has been referred to as caput medusae (or the ‘head of Medusa’)",

      explanation: "Fibrolamellar HCC is a rare hepatic neoplasm that accounts for less than 1% of HCC in the United States. This tumour has unique clinicopathologic features that are significantly different compared with conventional HCC. Fibrolamellar HCC predominantly occurs in young individuals. On MRI, fibrolamellar HCC is usually hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The fibrous central scar is typically hypointense on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images. This feature can help to distinguish fibrolamellar HCC from FNH because the central scar in the latter is predominantly T2 hyperintense. The presence of intralesional fat has not been reported in fibrolamellar HCC. Calcification may be difficult to identify on MRI. Gadolinium contrast enhancement characteristics of fibrolamellar HCC mimic the patterns seen on CT showing marked heterogeneous contrast enhancement on the arterial phase and becoming isointense or hypointense on the portal venous and delayed phase. Some authors have reported that fibrolamellar HCC does not retain hepatobiliary-specific contrast agents, such as gadoxetate disodium and gadobenate dimeglumine, on the hepatobiliary phase, which potentially may be useful in differentiating fibrolamellar HCC from FNH",

      answer: "Cardiac concussion results in abnormal cardiac enzymes",
      explanation: "Blunt cardiac injury (BCI) is the most common type of cardiac injury after blunt thoracic trauma. In cardiac concussion, the mildest form of cardiac injury, there is no myocardial cell damage or elevated enzyme levels. Cardiac contusion can present as bilateral cardiogenic pulmonary oedema and elevated cardiac enzymes. Echocardiography shows increased myocardial echogenicity and focal systolic hypokinesia, and it is useful in diagnosing other traumatic cardiac injuries that are commonly associated with myocardial contusion, such as pericardial effusion, tamponade, traumatic ventricular septal defect and valvular injury. Typically, traumatic ventricular septal defects occur in the muscular portion of the interventricular septum, near the cardiac apex. Haemopericardium is commonly associated with cardiac rupture. Tamponade resulting from ventricular rupture is often fatal; however, bleeding from lower pressure atria may be survivable. Besides cardiac chamber rupture, traumatic haemopericardium may also result from aortic root injury, myocardial contusion and coronary artery laceration. Traumatic pericardial rupture resulting from blunt chest trauma is rare. Tearing may involve either the pleuropericardium or the diaphragmatic pericardium. Cardiac herniation is a serious complication of pericardial rupture",

      answer: "Low citrate peak, high choline/creatine peak",
      explanation: "MRS is a modality that provides information about the cellular metabolites within the prostate gland; it displays the relative concentrations of key chemical constituents, such as citrate, choline and creatine. The normal prostate gland contains low levels of choline and high levels of citrate, whereas prostate cancers have increased levels of choline and decreased levels of citrate. The high choline levels in prostate tumours are related to increased cell turnover. In prostate cancers, the levels of zinc in secretary epithelial cells are lower, which eventually leads to diminished amounts of citrate. Thus, the ratio of choline to citrate is an index of malignancy. The ratio of choline (Cho) plus creatine (Cr) to citrate (Cit) ([Cho + Cr]/Cit) has been widely studied and cut-off values have been suggested for detection of cancer. Besides analysis of choline, citrate and creatine content, newer image acquisition and analysis software may enable evaluation of other metabolites, such as polyamine peaks, which have also been associated with prostate cancers. MR spectroscopy of tissue samples revealed that levels of polyamines (putrescine and spermine) were reduced in prostate cancer compared with the levels in benign tissue",

      explanation: "Angiomyolipoma (AML) is a benign, unencapsulated mesenchymal tumour that is composed of varying proportions of three elements: smooth muscle cells, thick-walled blood vessels and mature adipose tissue. AML occurs more commonly in the kidneys; hepatic involvement is rare. In contrast to renal AML, which is associated with tuberous sclerosis in 20% of patients, hepatic AML is associated with tuberous sclerosis in only 6%. AML can be histologically classified on the basis of fat content into mixed, lipomatous (70% fat), myomatous (10% fat) and angiomatous types. US, CT and MR imaging typically demonstrate the fat component and prominent central vessels. At US, AML may be highly echogenic and is then indistinguishable from haemangiomas. Frequently, AML has a high fat content, with high signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a significant drop in signal intensity on fat-suppressed images. AML demonstrates early intense contrast enhancement that peaks later than that of a HCC. Dynamic contrast-enhanced CT or MR images obtained during the early phase of enhancement may be useful in discriminating between AML and fat-containing HCC. The fatty areas of AMLs are well vascularised and enhance early, whereas steatotic foci in HCC are relatively avascular and have less contrast enhancement. However, unlike renal AML, 50% of hepatic AMLs lack considerable fat content. Because of this variable fat content, it is difficult to accurately distinguish AML from other hepatic tumours",

Various conditions, such as prostatitis, haemorrhage, atrophy, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and post-treatment changes can mimic cancer. Cancers in the central gland are even more challenging to detect than peripheral zone cancers, because the signal characteristics of the normal and hypertrophic central gland are usually similar to those of the tumour on T2-weighted images. Prostate cancers often include tightly packed glandular elements with increased cellular density and diminished extracellular spaces, which can be detected as high-signal-intensity foci on raw DW-MRI (restricted diffusion) but are low in signal on apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps.

Although the precise pathogenic mechanism of hepatic adenomas is still unknown, the use of oestrogen-containing or androgen-containing steroid medications clearly increases their prevalence, number and size within the affected population and often within individual patients. Moreover, this causal relationship is related to dose and duration, with the greatest risk encountered in patients taking large doses of oestrogen or androgen for prolonged periods of time. In women who have never used oral contraceptives, the annual incidence of hepatic adenoma is about 1 per million. This increases to 30–40 per million in long-term users of oral contraceptives.

      explanation: "DCE-MRI evaluates the vascularity of tumours by providing quantitative kinetic parameters that reflect the flow of blood and the permeability of the vessels. DCE-MRI increases the specificity of prostate tumour detection. Tumours show early enhancement and early washout of the contrast agent – the higher the tumour grade, the higher would be the permeability parameters (Ktrans – wash-in, Kep – washout). A disadvantage of DCE-MRI is that small, low-grade tumours may not demonstrate abnormal enhancement. Furthermore, abnormal enhancement patterns can also be seen in patients with BPH, which can make assessment of the central gland difficult. However, in the glandular peripheral zone and anterior gland, DCE-MRI can be helpful in identifying lesions that are not suspected on T2-weighted images. The degree of enhancement on DCE-MRI correlates positively with tumour grade",

Most spinal cord lesions occur in the cervical cord. Cervical spinal MRI is particularly useful when the patient is suspected to have MS and brain lesions are absent. On T2-weighted spinal imaging, most plaques are peripherally located (commonly dorsolateral) and less than two vertebral body segments in length. The lesions tend to be multifocal and present as well-circumscribed foci with an increased T2 signal intensity. With acute spinal cord lesions, enhancement is frequently seen. Spinal cord atrophy, which may reflect axonal loss, may also be observed and is believed to be an important element in disability. Though rarely seen in other diseases, asymptomatic lesions of the spinal cord can be present in MS and may help lead to the correct diagnosis. Unlike its applicability to the brain, FLAIR imaging appears unreliable in the detection of MS lesions in the spinal cord. The short inversion time inversion-recovery (STIR) sequence has been found to be sensitive for lesion detection, particularly diffuse lesions",

      explanation: "The classic haemangioma is an asymptomatic lesion that is discovered at routine examination or autopsy. At US, the typical appearance is a homogeneous, hyperechoic mass with well-defined margins and posterior acoustic enhancement. The CT findings consist of a hypoattenuating lesion on non-enhanced images. After intravenous administration of contrast material, arterial-phase CT shows early, peripheral, globular enhancement of the lesion. The attenuation of the peripheral nodules is equal to that of the adjacent aorta. Venous-phase CT shows centripetal enhancement that progresses to uniform filling .This enhancement persists on delayed-phase images. At MR imaging, haemangiomas are characterised by well-defined margins and high signal intensity on T2-weighted images, which is identical to that of cerebrospinal fluid. Specificity is improved by using serial gadolinium-enhanced gradient-echo imaging. The gadolinium intake is similar to the intake of iodinated contrast material during enhanced CT. With T2-weighted spin-echo and dynamic gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences, the sensitivity and specificity of MR imaging are 98% and the accuracy is 99%.

It typically affects middle-aged to elderly people and has acute and chronic phases with differing radiographic appearances. The acute phase, also known as the active or osteolytic phase, is characterised by aggressive bone resorption secondary to disordered osteoclastic activity. This manifests as lucency within the medulla of the long bones, typically in a flame shape or ‘blade of grass’ configuration. Over time, osteoblastic activity overtakes the osteoclastic resorption, resulting in osteosclerosis, cortical thickening and increased trabeculation. Giant cell tumour is a benign neoplasm of the mature skeleton, seen almost exclusively in those under 30 years of age.

Venous infarction manifests as a low-attenuation lesion with or without subcortical haemorrhage. Brain lesions are related to a venous distribution.

FNH shows intense homogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase and enhancement of the central scar in the later phases of gadolinium-enhanced imaging. FNH does not have a tumour capsule, although the pseudocapsule surrounding some FNH lesions may be quite prominent. The pseudocapsule of FNH results from compression of the surrounding liver parenchyma by the FNH, perilesion vessels and inflammatory reaction. The pseudocapsule is usually a few millimetres thick and typically shows high signal intensity on T2-weighted images. The pseudocapsule may show enhancement on delayed contrast-enhanced images. A central scar is present at imaging in most patients with FNH. The amount of scar tissue within FNH and the size of the central scar may vary. The central scar is typically high in signal intensity on T2-weighted images and low in signal intensity on T1-weighted images. It shows visible enhancement on delayed contrast-enhanced images. High signal intensity of the central scar may be caused by the inflammatory reaction around the ductular proliferation as well as the vessels within the septa and central scar.

      answer: "Basal meningitis suggests neurosyphilis",
      explanation: "The finding of diffuse cerebral atrophy in HIV can be accompanied by diffuse, confluent, ill-defined areas of abnormally increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images of the periventricular white matter. No enhancement is noted. These findings were initially attributed to CMV infection, as autopsy studies have shown that a high percentage of AIDS patients had concomitant CMV infection of the CNS. It was subsequently recognised that HIV is neurotrophic and directly infects the CNS; these global abnormalities were then attributed to a subacute encephalitis caused by HIV. It now seems likely that both HIV and CMV can cause subacute encephalitis and encephalopathy; these conditions have an identical non-specific imaging appearance. CMV encephalopathy appears to manifest itself late in the illness, whereas HIV rather than H1V dementia (although usually presenting late) can occasionally be the AIDS-defining illness. In addition to subacute encephalitis, CMV infection can manifest as a more virulent ventriculoencephalitis. This is most often seen in concert with CMV infection elsewhere in the body (such as CMV retinitis) and is usually a late manifestation of AIDS. The infection appears to begin in the ependymal or subependymal region and spread into the adjacent brain. The ventricles are enlarged, and hypoattenuation on CT or increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI is noted in the periventricular white matter. Ill-defined periventricular enhancement can also be seen following injection of contrast medium. Meningitis – particularly basilar meningitis – and hydrocephalus occur often in the setting of neurotuberculosis. Meningitis manifests on CT scans and MR images as prominent enhancement and thickening of the meninges and it can be associated with infarcts secondary to vascular stenosis or occlusion. Neurosyphilis, which is being diagnosed with increased frequency among patients with AIDS, can cause infarcts secondary to arteritis",

Other major complications include placental abruption, acute renal failure, pulmonary oedema, pleural and pericardial effusions, hepatic infarction, haematoma and rupture. Pelvic pain may occur in the setting of haemoperitoneum. Spontaneous intrahepatic haemorrhage and rupture likely result from toxaemia-related vasculopathy with endothelial damage, leading to haemorrhage. Supportive therapy is usually offered initially, with capsular rupture necessitating surgery. Embolisation of the hepatic artery may be attempted. CT is important in initial diagnosis and for serial follow-up. Findings may include subcapsular or intrahepatic haemorrhage, capsular rupture and areas of confluent necrosis secondary to infarction.

      answer: "SAPHO syndrome",
      explanation: "The acronym SAPHO (synovitis, acne, palmoplantar pustulosis, hyperostosis and osteitis), which was coined in 1987, is applied to occurrences of a wide spectrum of aseptic neutrophilic dermatoses in association with aseptic osteoarticular lesions. The sternoclavicular joint (most frequently affected) is involved in 65%–90% of cases. Hyperostosis and osteosclerosis are characteristic findings at conventional radiography and CT. Other findings include joint erosion and ankylosis. In the presence of active lesions, MR imaging with T2-weighted or STIR sequence may depict bone marrow oedema, a feature that helps differentiate active lesions from chronic ones. The ‘bull’s head’ sign (i.e., increased radiotracer uptake in the sternal manubrium and both sternoclavicular joints at delayed scintigraphy) is highly specific for the diagnosis of SAPHO and may obviate biopsy. Acute septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint is an uncommon infectious condition that is usually monoarticular and insidious in onset. Changes that are visible at CT include destruction of the articular surface, widening of the joint space, gas and fluid collections in the chest wall and mediastinum, and mediastinal soft-tissue stranding. MR images in addition may depict bone marrow oedema. The sternoclavicular joint can be affected by osteoarthrosis, RA, and seronegative and crystalline arthropathy, which depict their respective specific features on imaging; however, imaging is often non-specific",

US is well established as a primary investigation for patients presenting with a lump in the neck, and FNA cytology is also established as initial investigation for lesions in the head and neck.

      explanation: "The plain film findings and clinical history are suggestive of acute appendicitis, which is the most common reason for abdominal surgery in children. It is one of the most common causes of intestinal obstruction in children. Other causes include adhesions, intussusception, incarcerated inguinal hernia, malrotation with volvulus and Meckel’s diverticulum. The primary imaging modality in suspected acute appendicitis remains controversial. Several authors advocate plain films, US and CT as primary diagnostic sets, with various arguments. On plain films, a faecolith or appendicolith with small bowel obstruction (seen in 10% of cases) and displacement of bowel gas from the right iliac fossa are all typical signs of acute appendicitis. However, an abdominal US examination is the preferred imaging modality of choice for investigation of acute appendicitis in children rather than abdominal radiograph. Acute cholecystitis and renal colic are not common diagnoses in children. Intussusception most often occurs between 3 months and 1 year of age",

Fine, external lobulations are a common feature, and enhancement of septa and the cyst wall may be seen. A fibrous central scar with or without a characteristic stellate pattern of calcification is seen in 30% of cases and, when demonstrated with CT or MR imaging, is highly specific and is considered to be virtually pathognomonic for serous cystadenoma. Pancreatic ductal dilatation is an uncommon finding in these patients. The macrocystic or oligocystic variant of these tumours is very uncommon and is seen in less than 10% of cases. Either of these variants can take the form of a single dominant macrocavity, in which case it will appear as a unilocular cyst or may contain fewer large (2 cm) cysts. The latter variant is classified as a macrocystic lesion and may be difficult to differentiate from a mucinous cystic tumour. Mucinous cystic neoplasms (mucinous cystadenomas) mainly involve the body and tail of the pancreas and do not communicate with the pancreatic duct. At CT/MR, they are multilocular macrocystic lesions occasionally containing debris or hemorrhage. The complex internal architecture of the cyst, including septa and an internal wall, is best appreciated at MR imaging and endoscopic US, allowing differentiation from serous cystadenomas. Although peripheral eggshell calcification is not frequently seen at CT, it is specific for a mucinous cystic neoplasm and is highly predictive of malignancy. Pseudopapillary tumour is a solid tumour with a cystic component. Others in this group are islet cell tumour, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and metastasis",

      answer: "Pleomorphic adenoma",
      explanation: "Nearly 80% of benign parotid neoplasms are pleomorphic adenomas. The most common malignancy of the parotid gland is mucoepidermoid carcinoma and that of the submandibular gland is adenoid cystic carcinoma. On non-enhanced and enhanced T1-weighted series, no histologic discrimination is possible because almost all masses are low in intensity and enhance. Benign cysts (mucous retention cyst, lympho-epithelial cyst, first branchial cleft cyst, ranula, etc.) appear hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and, depending on the presence of haemorrhage, infection or hyperproteinaceous fluid, the T1-weighted image may show intermediate (solid-appearing) intensity. For this reason, administration of contrast material is helpful because cysts usually enhance on their periphery, whereas pleomorphic adenomas enhance solidly. Adenoid cystic carcinoma has a very high rate of perineural spread (50%–60%). Cystic degeneration of a benign-appearing neoplasm suggests a Warthin tumour or pleomorphic adenoma. Multiple parotid masses are usually due to lymphadenopathy or Warthin tumours, the latter appearing almost exclusively in the parotid gland, usually in the tail of the gland in older men. Specific signs predictive of malignancy were T2 hypointensity of the parotid tumour, ill-defined margins, diffuse growth, infiltration of subcutaneous tissue and lymphadenopathy. The predilection of deep lobe involvement was only indicative but not significant for malignancy. However, involvement of both lobes was significant for malignant lesions. Clinically, involvement of the facial nerve is highly suspicious of a malignant mass. For determination of benign disease, a strong signal intensity on T2-weighted images, well-defined borders and a location in the superficial lobe were significant MR imaging findings for benignity. The degree of tumour enhancement after contrast administration did not help to distinguish benign from malignant tumours, though there was a tendency towards strong enhancement of benign tumours",

In patients with indeterminate CT findings, further characterisation with MR imaging or endoscopic US may be possible. At MR imaging, the microcysts may be seen as numerous discrete foci with bright signal intensity on T2-weighted images. Likewise, endoscopic US can help accurately depict these small microcysts as discrete small anechoic areas.

      answer: "Soft-tissue rim sign",
      explanation: "Before a tumour can be described as primarily retroperitoneal, the possibility that the tumour originates from a retroperitoneal organ must be excluded. When a mass deforms the edge of an adjacent organ into a ‘beak’ shape, it is likely that the mass arises from that organ (beak sign). When a large mass arises from a small organ, the organ sometimes becomes undetectable. This is known as the phantom organ sign. When a tumour compresses an adjacent plastic organ (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, inferior vena cava) that is not the organ of origin, the organ is deformed into a crescent shape (negative embedded organ sign). In contrast, when part of an organ appears to be embedded in the tumour (positive embedded organ sign), it is likely that the tumour originates from the involved organ. Hypervascular masses are often supplied by feeding arteries that are prominent enough to be visualised at CT or MR imaging, a finding that provides an important key to understanding the origin of the mass. Some tumours grow and extend into spaces between pre-existing structures and surrounding vessels without compressing their lumina. Lymphangiomas, ganglioneuromas and lymphomas are examples of such tumours manifesting with the CT angiogram sign’ or ‘floating aorta sign’.

Power Doppler, contrast-enhanced sonography and MR imaging (especially T1-weighted contrast-enhanced sequences with spectral fat saturation and water-weighted inversion-recovery images) are very helpful in identifying the pathologic condition. X-rays are often normal at this stage. MR imaging is an excellent tool for assessing synovial swelling and volume. The use of a T1-weighted spin-echo sequence early after intravenous contrast material administration is highly recommended, as it helps differentiate effusion and synovium. Plain radiograph shows soft-tissue swelling, joint effusion and joint widening. Para-articular osteoporosis is cited as an early sign of joint involvement in RA. Up to 47% of patients may develop erosions within 1 year after onset of RA. MR imaging demonstrates erosions first. Sometimes, contrast enhancement helps distinguish erosions and pre-erosions from simple and degenerative bone cysts, which are less likely to enhance.

It may show thick walls or internal septations or echoes. On CT, it is seen as a well-circumscribed, non-enhancing mass of homogenous low attenuation. Wall thickening and enhancement may occur due to associated inflammation. Metastatic nodes from head-and-neck malignancy, especially papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, are the most common types of nodal metastases presenting as cystic masses in the neck. Eighty percent of the cystic masses in patients over 40 years of age are due to necrotic lymph nodes. On US, a central cystic area with thick irregular walls or an eccentric solid component may be seen.

      answer: "Side-branch intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm",
      explanation: "IPMNs can be classified as main duct, branch duct (side-branch) or mixed IPMNs, depending on the site and extent of involvement. Main duct IPMN is a morphologically distinct entity and cannot be included in the discussion of pancreatic cysts. However, a side-branch IPMN or a mixed IPMN (in which a side-branch tumour extends to the main pancreatic duct) can have the morphologic features of a complex pancreatic cyst, making clear-cut distinction from a mucinous cystic neoplasm difficult. Identification of a septated cyst that communicates with the main pancreatic duct is highly suggestive of a side-branch or mixed IPMN. However, it is important to be aware that lack of communication with the main pancreatic duct at imaging does not exclude an IPMN. Currently, MR cholangiopancreatography is considered the modality of choice for demonstrating the morphologic features of the cyst (including septa and mural nodules), establishing the presence of communication between the cystic lesion and the pancreatic duct, and evaluating the extent of pancreatic ductal dilatation. Because these lesions are considered premalignant, surgical resection has typically been recommended. The occurrence of malignancy is significantly higher in main duct and mixed IPMNs than in side-branch IPMNs. Therefore, in cases of side-branch IPMN, the treatment decision should be based on the risk–benefit ratio, taking into account the patient’s clinical presentation, age and surgical risk and the size and imaging morphologic features of the cyst",

The echogenic portions of the lesion correlate with clusters of small, abnormal lymphatic channels. Fluid–fluid levels can be observed with a characteristic echogenic, haemorrhagic component layering in the dependent portion of the lesion. The most common pattern is that of a mass with low or intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted images and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. Infrequently, this lesion may be hyperintense on T1-weighted images, a finding associated with clotted blood or high lipid (chyle) content.

      answer: "The submucosal gas in pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis can mimic colonic polyps on a barium enema when viewed en face",

The patterns of pneumatosis vary from circular to linear to bubble and curvilinear gas collections. Such patterns can differentiate benign and clinically worrisome pneumatosis intestinalis. The circular form is usually benign and most often seen with pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis and affect the whole colon. Pseudopneumatosis is more common in the right colon because of the presence of liquid fecal matter. Linear or bubble- like air can be due to both benign and life- threatening causes, and its radiographic appearance alone does not allow differentiation between them. In PI due to benign causes, the bowel wall is usually normal. Additional CT findings such as soft-tissue thickening of the bowel wall, free fluid and peri-intestinal soft-tissue stranding are more frequently associated with clinically worrisome than benign pneumatosis intestinalis.

      answer: "Visualisation of a heartbeat",
      explanation: "Ninety-five percent of ectopic pregnancies are tubal; they occur mostly in the ampulla (70%). An adnexal mass that is separate from the ovary is the most common finding of a tubal pregnancy and is seen on US images. Although not common, an adnexal mass is more specific for an ectopic pregnancy when it contains a yolk sac or a living embryo. The tubal ring sign is the second most common sign of a tubal pregnancy. The tubal ring sign describes a hyperechoic ring surrounding an extrauterine gestational sac. A related finding is the ‘ring of fire’ sign, which is recognised by peripheral hypervascularity of the hyperechoic ring. The term previously described the high-velocity, low-impedance flow surrounding an ectopic adnexal pregnancy. Peripheral hypervascularity is a non-specific finding of the ring of fire sign and may also be seen surrounding a normal maturing follicle or a corpus luteal cyst. Location of the ring of fire in an ovary distinguishes a corpus luteal cyst from an ectopic pregnancy where the ring is extra-ovarian. Intrauterine findings of an ectopic pregnancy include a ‘normal endometrium’, a pseudo–gestational sac, a trilaminar endometrium and a thin-walled decidual cyst.

Similar internal echoes may occur in haemorrhagic cysts, dermoids and some ovarian carcinomas. Thus, it is important to carefully evaluate for other features like a solid component that would suggest a different diagnosis. An endometrioma is very likely when there are diffuse internal echoes in a cystic mass lacking other US features. Additional features reported include echogenic foci in the wall and small solid areas along the wall, most likely representing solid endometrial tissue, which can mimic malignant cysts. Endometrial solid deposits are less likely to be vascular on Doppler compared to tumour, but the role of Doppler imaging is unclear. A small percentage (probably <15%) of endometriomas have less-typical US features such as anechoic fluid, a fluid– fluid level, heterogeneity or calcification.

      answer: "Central to peripheral, caudal to rostral, dorsal to ventral",
      explanation: "Myelination begins at 16 weeks in utero and is far from complete at term birth. It continues during the first 2 years of life until it reaches the level of myelination seen in a normal adult brain. Learning development coincides with myelination. CT and MRI can be used to assess myelination. On CT, unmyelinated white matter will appear hypodense. Unmyelinated white matter will appear hypointense on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted. This can be confusing as many other conditions of interest in the neonate can cause T2-weighted hyperintensity. Knowing the pattern of normal myelination is therefore essential when interpreting paediatric neuroimaging",

      answer: "Heterogeneous content is detected within the mass on CT",
      explanation: "This uncommon, typically benign tumour is found mainly in young, non-Caucasian women between the second and third decades of life. It seems to have a predilection for Asian and African American women, although rare cases have been reported in children and men. Although most solid pseudopapillary tumours (SPTs) exhibit benign behaviour, malignant degeneration does occur. Patients with SPT of the pancreas are often clinically asymptomatic. They may present with a gradually enlarging abdominal mass or complain of vague abdominal pain or discomfort. The abdomen is usually non-tender on palpation, but obstructive symptoms may occur if the tumour grows large enough to compress adjacent viscera. There are usually no abnormalities in clinical laboratory tests (e.g., serum amylase levels) or in pancreatic cancer markers (e.g., CA19–9, carcinoembryonic antigen, fetoprotein). The diagnosis is not uncommonly made incidentally at abdominal examination, US or CT performed for other reasons. SPT of the pancreas has distinctive pathologic features. The mass may occur anywhere in the pancreas but is most frequently found in the head or tail. At gross examination, the mass is usually large (mean maximum dimension 9.3 cm) and well encapsulated and contains varying amounts of necrosis, haemorrhage and cystic change",

      answer: "Hydrosalpinx",
      explanation: "Hydrosalpinx should be suspected based on location and configuration. Characteristically, it is a tubular-shaped cystic structure that is separate from the ipsilateral ovary. Its configuration may reveal indentations on the opposite sides of the wall referred to as the ‘waist sign’. The waist sign in combination with a tubular-shaped cystic mass has been found to be pathognomonic of a hydrosalpinx. Incomplete septa, due to the wall of the tube folding on itself, or small mural nodules, due to thickening of endosalpingeal folds (termed ‘beads on a string’), are also typical and are more predictive of hydrosalpinx when the mass is tubular in shape. The distinction from tumour nodule is easier when one recognises that the mass is separate from the ovary. Additionally, the solid component of the rare fallopian tube carcinoma is usually larger and less numerous than the multiple small nodules due to thickened endosalpingeal folds",

      answer: "Mid-shaft of the second metatarsal",
      explanation: "Stress fractures of the metatarsals account for between 9% and 24.6% of stress fractures in athletes. Plain radiographic evaluation may reveal normal appearances. Two to three weeks after the injury, periosteal bone reaction may be visible on radiographs. MRI has high sensitivity in the diagnosis of these fractures, depicting oedema of the bone marrow and periosteum. A hypointense fracture line may also be visible on MRI. The most common site of metatarsal stress fractures are the distal shaft and neck of the second and third metatarsals, especially in long-distance runners. They are usually thinner than the first metatarsal and bear a large amount of weight during the ‘push off’ phase of running. Stress fractures of the fifth metatarsal base occurring approximately 1.5 cm distal to the tubercle, at the junction of the metaphysis and diaphysis (Jones’ fracture), deserve special mention as high-performance athletes with this injury, because of their propensity to be delayed or non-union, and refracture, may benefit from early operative intervention",

A non-functioning or ‘cold’ nodule was thought to indicate increased risk of malignancy, with 5%–15% of these being malignant FNA should be the first-line investigation for assessment of all solitary nodules or a dominant nodule in a multinodular goitre. US is well established as a primary investigation for patients presenting with a lump in the neck; moreover, the cost-effectiveness and diagnostic accuracy of FNA can be increased by using US guidance and the presence of an on-site cytopathologist",

The wavy margins result from interdigitation of soft thymic tissue in the intercostal spaces. Sometimes a definite notch (unilateral or bilateral) can be seen at the junction of the inferior aspect of the gland and the cardiac silhouette. The thymus gradually involutes with age and may acutely shrink during periods of bodily stress. During the recovery period, it grows back to its original size or even larger, a phenomenon known as thymic rebound hyperplasia.
