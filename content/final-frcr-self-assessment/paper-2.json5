    "stem": "An athletic 28 year old man presents with intermittent claudication affecting the right leg particularly when running or playing sports. Examination is normal with present lower limb pulses. The vascular team query popliteal artery entrapment syndrome and request further imaging to evaluate further and help plan surgical management. What would be the most appropriate test?",
    "options": [
      "Angiography",

      "Arterial phase CT",
      "MRI",
      "Ultrasound"
    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "MRI",
    "explanation": "Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome is caused by symptomatic compression or occlusion of the popliteal artery by adjacent structures. It commonly presents in athletic males and is most frequently caused by the medial head of gastrocnemius or occasionally popliteus. It presents as intermittent claudication, which may be exacerbated by plantar flexion, or with thrombosis and can be bilateral in two-thirds. MRI is the favoured imaging modality because it demonstrates the underlying anatomy and aids surgical planning. Arterial phase CT and angiography would help to delineate the popliteal artery but the underlying soft tissue definition is better on MRI than CT. Similarly, ultrasound can help to demonstrate the artery and plantar flexion whilst scanning may reveal arterial compression, but MRI would still be favoured for surgical planning. A knee radiograph would not provide much benefit in this scenario",

    "stem": "A 49 year old dialysis patient is referred to the rheumatology clinic with back and joint pain involving bilateral shoulders and hips. Radiographs of the hips and shoulders demonstrate erosions and subchondral cyst formation. Joint space is well preserved. An MRI spine reveals normal alignment. There is a low T1 and T2 signal lesion at the inferior endplate of the L3 vertebral body adjacent to the L3/4 disc. This lesion enhances following contrast. The L3/4 disc returns normal MRI signal. Similar low signal intra-articular nodules are seen on MRI of the right shoulder. Which finding would indicate the most appropriate diagnosis?",
    "options": [
      "Congo red staining of synovial fluid",
      "Cartilage pigmentation on arthroscopy",
      "Growth of Staphylococcus aureus on blood culture",

      "Weakly positive birefringent crystals on polarised light microscopy of synovial fluid"
    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Congo red staining of synovial fluid",
    "explanation": "The case describes amyloid arthropathy caused by amyloid deposition in the joints. This can be primary, or secondary to dialysis-dependent renal failure or multiple myeloma. It often presents as a large joint, bilateral, symmetrical arthropathy. Shoulder pain and carpal tunnel syndrome are common. Radiographic findings include preservation of joint space with subchondral cyst formation and well circumscribed erosions. MRI can reveal low T1 and T2 intra-articular nodules and bone lesions which enhance following contrast. Amyloid protein stains with Congo red. Cartilage pigmentation is seen in ochronosis, otherwise known as alkaptonuria. Homogentisic acid accumulates within cartilage leading to dark pigmentation and premature degeneration. Synovial pigmentation is a feature of pigmented villonodular synovitis due to haemosiderin staining. Staphylococcus aureus is associated with spondylodiscitis. Amyloid lesions in the spine can resemble discitis; however, the disc would be expected to have high T2 signal rather than the low signal described in the question. Secondary hyperparathyroidism is associated with chronic renal failure too but features include metastatic calcification and osteosclerosis with the ‘rugger jersey’ spine appearance. Weakly positive birefringent crystals are associated with calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD), also known as pseudogout. This can be commonly misdiagnosed as osteoarthritis due to overlapping features but the distribution is more unusual and chondrocalcinosis is frequently present",

    "answer": "Aperistalsis of the lower oesophagus",
    "explanation": "The oesophagus is the most commonly affected part of the gastrointestinal tract in scleroderma. There is fibrosis of the smooth muscle, resulting in a dilated oesophagus with absent or reduced peristalsis in the distal two-thirds. A mediastinal air-fluid level may be apparent on frontal imaging due to poor oesophageal emptying. The upper oesophagus is composed of skeletal muscle and is therefore unaffected. Aspiration, reflux, Barrett oesophagus and distal strictures are all potential complications. Warm fluids may help the passage of contrast in achalasia but this is not a feature of scleroderma",

    "stem": "A 23 year old cyclist is on the Intensive Care Unit following a road traffic collision. Thirty-six hours previously he was knocked off his bike by a car at approximately 20 mph. Initial admission CT demonstrated a right subcapsular renal haematoma. The team call you for an ultrasound urinary tract, including Doppler assessment, due to uncontrollable hypertension and increasing right flank pain which has developed over the past 4 hours. Ultrasound shows an unobstructed right kidney with a substantial right subcapsular collection. There is vascularity within the kidney and the arterial trace shows forward flow in diastole with a resistive index of 0.9. Appearances of the left kidney and bladder are within normal limits. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": [

      "Renal artery stenosis",
      "Renal vein thrombosis",
      "Ureteric obstruction"
    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Page kidney",
    "explanation": "Arterial resistive index can be raised above normal limits (0.70 is the upper limit of normal) for several reasons in native kidneys, including renal artery stenosis, ureteric obstruction, hypotension and a perinephric fluid collection. In transplant kidneys problems such as transplant rejection, renal vein thrombosis, drug toxicity and acute tubular necrosis are also within the differential. Page kidney is a condition caused by a subcapsular collection compressing the kidney and typically presenting with flank pain and hypertension. Compression of the renal vasculature leads to activation of the renin angiotensin system. The history and clinical presentation in this case is key. On ultrasound there is often a distorted appearance to the kidney due to the subcapsular haematoma and an elevated resistive index. CT may show reduced enhancement of the kidney along with the perinephric collection. Pseudoaneurysm is possible following trauma; however, these would be more common follow a laceration. Renal artery stenosis would be unlikely to acutely develop in this clinical setting. Renal vein thrombosis is more common in transplant kidneys than native kidneys and the forward flow in diastole on the arterial trace is reassuring. The lack of hydronephrosis and the clinical history makes ureteric obstruction unlikely",

    "answer": "Nephroblastoma",
    "explanation": "Nephroblastoma (also known as a Wilms tumour) is the most common renal mass in childhood. This is usually heterogenous in appearance due to necrosis, haemorrhage and less commonly, calcification. It typically displaces adjacent structures compared to neuroblastoma which encases them. Neuroblastoma also tends to affect a slightly younger age group. Assessment of the adjacent vascular structures such as the renal vein and inferior vena cava is important. It typically metastasises to adjacent para-aortic nodes, lungs and liver. Mesoblastic nephroma is the commonest neonatal renal mass and usually presents before 3 months of age so does not fit with the patient in this case. It also can have a heterogenous appearance. It does not typically invade the vasculature",

A chest radiograph is abnormal, and the patient is referred for a CT chest abdomen pelvis to investigate further. CT reveals multiple perihilar and peribronchovascular ill-defined nodular opacities with surrounding ground glass opacification and marked bilateral enhancing hilar lymph node enlargement. The abdomen and pelvis are normal. He is considered too unwell for a bronchoscopy and so you suggest a gallium scan to aid diagnosis. The thoracic abnormalities are not tracer avid.

This condition is seen in patients with HIV and CD4 count <200 cells/mm3. The main differential diagnosis in this patient is lymphoma; however lymphoma associated with HIV (mostly non-Hodgkin) is usually associated with disseminated extra-nodal disease involving the CNS, GI tract and bone marrow. Lack of avidity on gallium scan is more in favour of Kaposi sarcoma. Lymphoma is gallium avid. Pneumocystis pneumonia can occur in patients with CD4 count <200 cells/mm3. The imaging appearances are of diffuse ground glass opacification but enhancing lymph node enlargement is not a feature. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) can be seen in patients with CD4 >200 cells/mm3. The predominant imaging features of pulmonary CMV are multiple ground glass pulmonary nodules and consolidation. Mycobacterium avium is seen in patients with CD4 count <50 cells/mm3",

Adjacent soft tissue swelling is also demonstrated and there is periosteal reaction along the diaphyses of some of the middle phalanges. The metacarpal phalangeal joints have normal appearances. Bone density is well preserved. You also note the patient is awaiting radiographs of the right shoulder and left knee due to pain and swelling. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "Reactive arthritis",
      "Rheumatoid arthritis"
    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Psoriatic arthritis",
    "explanation": "Psoriatic arthritis is one of the seronegative spondyloarthropathies. It most commonly affects the hands and feet and can manifest as a symmetric polyarthropathy or asymmetric oligoarthropathy at these sites. When affecting larger joints it is typically asymmetrical. The spine and sacroiliac joints are also commonly involved. Findings in the hands and feet include a predominance for the distal joints, marginal erosions, periostitis, joint space widening and preserved bone density. As the disease progresses, changes such as terminal tuft resorption and pencil-in-cup deformity can also be seen. Rheumatoid arthritis tends to be symmetrical with a predilection for the metacarpal phalangeal joints causing periarticular osteopenia and erosions. Reactive arthritis (previously known as Reiter syndrome) preferentially affects young men and the feet. It can also cause periosteal reaction but has a predilection for the first metatarsal phalangeal joint and calcaneus. Erosive osteoarthritis also typically affects the distal interphalangeal joints but causes more central erosions and marginal osteophytes leading to the ‘gull-wing’ appearance. Gout is more likely to be monoarticular affecting the first metatarsal phalangeal joint. It also does not commonly cause periarticular osteopenia. The erosions are more peripherally sited than in psoriatic or rheumatoid arthritis and are well-defined with sharp overhanging edges",

    "explanation": "MRI is helpful in Crohn’s disease for monitoring disease activity and has the added benefit of no radiation, particularly for younger patients with the condition. Fistulae are possible in Crohn’s disease due to transmural bowel inflammation. Bowel wall ulceration can progress to full thickness fistulae which can communicate between bowel loops as well as between bowel and bladder, perineum or sometimes the vagina. Although all the sequences in the question may be employed for an MRI looking for manifestations of Crohn’s disease, fistulae can be visualised particularly well with fat supressed T2 weighted imaging, where they appear as a high signal tract. Following contrast administration the fistulae will enhance and post contrast enhancement can also highlight other areas of disease activity within the abdomen and pelvis",

On the most inferior slices a lesion is seen adjacent to the proximal right femur. The patient denies any pain in this area. The duty radiologist suggests extending the MRI imaging to include the entire area of abnormality. The mass is approximately 50 mm, with very low peripheral T1 and T2 signal. Centrally the T1 signal is isointense to muscle and T2 signal is heterogenous. On STIR sequences there is marked peripheral hyperintensity in the surrounding muscle.

      "Ultrasound guided biopsy",
      "Post contrast MRI sequence"
    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Radiograph of the proximal femur",
    "explanation": "The question describes typical MRI findings of myositis ossificans. This condition causes heterotopic bone formation, most commonly following trauma but it occurs in paraplegic patients, sometimes with no history of preceding trauma. Typical radiographic appearances include a lesion adjacent to the knee or hip with peripheral calcification. Calcification will be low signal on T1 MRI sequences and sometimes the early features can include quite marked increased STIR signal extending into the muscle. The main imaging differential is paraosteal osteosarcoma but these tend to calcify centrally rather than peripherally and on MRI they are often low signal on both T1 and T2 sequences. Radiographs can therefore help to confirm benignity. Myositis ossificans is a ‘don’t touch’ lesion, meaning the radiological features are characteristic and they should not be biopsied. Histology from myositis ossificans can be difficult to differentiate from a soft tissue osteosarcoma. Nuclear medicine bone scan may show uptake in both myositis ossificans and malignant lesions and will therefore not help to differentiate. Similarly, early myositis ossificans will likely show enhancement on both CT angiogram and MRI",

These are large, associated with other conditions such as pulmonary hypoplasia and usually in a left posterolateral position. Retroperitoneal contents such as fat, the spleen and left kidney may herniate into them. They may be diagnosed on antenatal scans. Morgagni herniae are less common, usually smaller and in a right anteromedial position. The transverse colon and stomach may herniate.

The patient experienced a period of hypertension secondary to pre-eclampsia which has now resolved. Clinically the differential lies between posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) and a posterior circulation infarct.\nWhich of the following would be most consistent with the finding of an acute posterior cerebral artery territory infarct rather than PRES?",

The distribution is variable and can include more anterior structures such as the watershed zones, inferior temporal and posterior frontal lobes but it is classically described as occipitoparietal. There is T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity in the affected regions due to oedema which manifests as hypodensity on CT. Given the right clinical history one differential diagnosis is a posterior circulation stroke. Microhaemorrhage can be a feature in both diagnoses; however, whereas an acute stroke would lead to restricted diffusion, this finding is not typical in PRES and can be a helpful distinguishing factor",

CT confirms a 17-mm right middle lobe lung nodule and MDT discussion suggests CT guided lung biopsy. On the day the patient is positioned, the skin is cleaned and 10 mL 1% lidocaine is injected into the skin and soft tissues; however the patient continues to experience discomfort and requests more local anaesthetic.\nWhat is the maximum additional volume of 1% lidocaine you can safely administer to this patient?",
    "options": ["0 mL", "5 mL", "10 mL", "15 mL", "25 mL"],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "10 mL",
    "explanation": "According to the British National Formulary, the maximum dose of 1% lidocaine is 3 mg/kg up to 200 mg and equates to 20 mL. For 2% lidocaine the maximum dose is therefore 10 mL. The 2018 Royal College of Radiologists guidance on sedation, analgesia and anaesthesia in radiology differs slightly and suggests 4 mg/kg (around a total of 30 mL of 1% lidocaine for an adult of typical weight) as the maximum dose. Regardless of either recommendation, the correct answer for this question is 10 mL because 20 mL is not a given option. The maximum dose for lidocaine with adrenaline is greater at 7 mg/kg because it decreases the rate of systemic absorption. Lidocaine with adrenaline has a faster onset and is generally used for procedures where there may be a greater chance of bleeding or where bloodless fields are required, for example dental and tracheostomy procedures. Symptoms and signs of lidocaine toxicity include drowsiness, disorientation, visual and auditory disturbances, numbness and tingling of the tongue and/or mouth and a metallic taste. If untreated this can potentially lead to seizures and cardiac arrhythmia. Treatment includes resuscitation with an ABCD approach, calling the appropriate medical emergency team, supportive measures and intralipid administration",

    "answer": "Achondroplasia",
    "explanation": "Features associated with achondroplasia on a spinal radiograph include an anteroinferior beak causing a bullet-shaped vertebrae and posterior vertebral body scalloping. Decreasing interpedicular distance and short pedicles increases the potential risk of canal stenosis. The mucopolysaccharidoses are associated with posterior vertebral body scalloping, and Hurler syndrome does also share a similar anteroinferior beak, but the other features make achondroplasia more likely. The vertebral body shape associated with Morquio syndrome is an anterior central beak (this could be remembered as Morquio – middle) and there is often platyspondyly. Thanatophoric dysplasia is also associated with platyspondyly and the typical ‘telephone handle’ appearance of the long bones. It overlaps with achondroplasia as both conditions cause narrowing of the interpedicular distance.

Sarcoidosis tends to show low signal on all MRI sequences and hypoenhancement compared to the rest of the spleen. Splenomegaly is also common. Similarly, splenomegaly is frequently a feature in lymphoma and the lesions are T1 and T2 low signal or isointense on MRI with hypoenhancement compared to the rest of the spleen.

    "explanation": "Pyloric stenosis most commonly presents in neonates with non-bilious vomiting. An olive-sized mass may be palpable in the right upper quadrant. Ultrasound will demonstrate a thickened pylorus. The diagnostic sonographic measurements can be slightly variable. The diameter of a single wall is usually >3 mm and the hypertrophied muscle will appear as a thickened hypoechoic layer surrounding internal hyperechoic mucosa. The overall pyloric transverse diameter will exceed 11 mm (13 mm in some publications) and the pyloric length will be >15–17 mm. The pyloric volume exceeds 1.5 cm3. On fluoroscopy, peristaltic waves may be seen with delayed gastric emptying. The ‘string’ sign represents a long pylorus with a thin lumen. The ‘tit’ or ‘shoulder’ sign is caused by the thickened pylorus indenting the antrum and the pyloric entrance may be beak shaped.

    "answer": "The pituitary gland usually shows peripheral enhancement",
    "explanation": "Pituitary apoplexy is caused by pituitary necrosis, which may be haemorrhagic. This is frequently secondary to an underlying pituitary lesion, such as a macroadenoma. CT is insensitive for the diagnosis, and the pituitary fossa is better imaged with MRI. The pituitary may show high T1 signal if the cause is haemorrhagic; however, this will also depend on the age of blood, and other haemorrhagic/proteinaceous/necrotic masses can also have high T1 signal. Enhancement is typically peripheral and the infarcted centre commonly demonstrates restricted diffusion",

    "answer": "Cholesterol granuloma",
    "explanation": "Cholesterol granulomas are a complication of chronic infection and can occur in the middle ear, mastoid or petrous apex. Due to their cholesterol content they are T1 and T2 hyperintense but their predisposition to haemorrhage means they may have a low signal haemosiderin rim. There may be thinning of the adjacent bone. They may enhance peripherally but do not demonstrate restricted diffusion. Cholesteatoma are an important differential for a middle ear mass but they have different signal characteristics with low T1, high T2 signal and restricted diffusion. Depending on location they may displace and erode the ossicles. A mucocoele may exhibit similar T1 and T2 hyperintensity as a cholesterol granuloma but they would not have the low signal rim and enhancement described in this case. Glomus tympanicum are highly vascular and demonstrate intense enhancement. Similar to paragangliomas elsewhere in the body, they can have a ‘salt-and-pepper’ appearance due to the presence of flow voids. A chondrosarcoma affecting the skull base would be centred on the bone rather than on the middle ear, although these masses may erode into the middle ear.

It manifests as thin-walled cysts of uniform size with normal intervening lung parenchyma. Patients with the condition can present with a pneumothorax and sometimes they develop chylous pleural effusion. It is associated with tuberous sclerosis (approximately 40% of patients with tuberous sclerosis have LAM). Pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis occurs most commonly in smokers. Early in the disease it is seen as 3- to 10-mm nodules in the mid-upper zones; later in the process the nodules undergo cystic degeneration. The cysts are typically irregularly shaped and can coalesce to form ‘bizarre’-shaped cysts. The lung parenchyma between cysts may demonstrate emphysematous change. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a genetic multisystem disease which is characterised by multiple lung cysts; these are predominantly in the lower zones with variable morphology and internal septation. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is associated with HIV and other connective tissue disorders such as Sjögren syndrome. Interstitial infiltrate causes findings of ground glass opacification, consolidation, centrilobular nodules and scattered pulmonary cysts. Pneumocystis jiroveciiis an infection of immunocompromised patients. The imaging finding in this fungal infection are typically of bilateral ground glass densities.

Löffler syndrome is another term for simple pulmonary eosinophilia and although sounding similar to Löfgren syndrome should not be confused with it. Patients are not usually particularly unwell, and chest radiograph should show transient infiltrates rather than being completely clear. Hilar lymph node enlargement is also not a feature.

It causes significant bowel wall thickening which may cause a ‘thumbprint’ appearance. Approximately 40% of cases can have ascites. It most commonly involves the entire colon including the rectum. Many radiological features of pseudomembranous colitis overlap with inflammatory bowel disease, and differentiation can be challenging. Wall thickening is typically more severe in pseudomembranous colitis and any hyperenhancement is centred on the mucosa due to the predominantly mucosal inflammation caused by the condition.

Other primary sites of renal metastases are breast, lung and the gastrointestinal tract. Primary lymphoma is rare in the kidney due to a lack of lymphoid tissue and therefore secondary lymphoma, often non-Hodgkins, would be more likely.

Patients often suffer with cardiac failure caused by the effects of iron deposition within the heart. A similar low signal appearance is seen in the hepatic parenchyma on liver MRI. Eventually iron deposition can lead to liver cirrhosis causing a small liver with a nodular contour. Musculoskeletal manifestations of haemochromatosis include a symmetrical arthropathy along with osteopenia. The heads of the second and third metacarpals are often squared with hook-like medial osteophytes. Alcohol excess can lead to liver cirrhosis and cardiac failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy, but this would cause reduced contractility and dilatation of all cardiac chambers. Haemosiderosis can cause similar liver MRI changes as haemochromatosis but it typically involves the liver, spleen and marrow rather than the heart. On cardiac MRI, amyloidosis can cause low myocardial signal intensity but you may also expect to see other associated features, such as wall thickening, restricted diastolic filling and subendocardial delayed enhancement. The liver and radiographic skeletal changes would not be typical. Cardiac sarcoidosis causes granuloma formation which lead to increased foci of T2 weighted signal which also hyper enhance",

It can be diagnosed incidentally if asymptomatic but it can be symptomatic, causing duodenal obstruction. It is associated with other conditions such as oesophageal atresia, tracheo-oesophageal fistula and Down syndrome. Pancreas divisum is the commonest congenital pancreatic abnormality caused by failure of ductal fusion leading to two ducts draining into the duodenum. MRCP and MRI pancreas is the most helpful test to diagnose the condition. It does not cause duodenal luminal narrowing. A duodenal diverticulum would appear as an outpouching from the duodenal wall which may be filled with gas, fluid or debris; these are often asymptomatic. There can be intraluminal diverticulum which can cause obstruction, similar to a duodenal web. Duodenal webs typically cause a ‘windsock’ appearance due to the membranous web projected into the duodenal lumen rather than an area of focal narrowing.

Abnormal copper deposition leads to high T2 signal in the tegmentum, caudate nuclei, thalami and putamina with sparing of the red nuclei and substantia nigra. Copper does not cause increased density on CT. Similarly, central nervous system iron deposition in haemochromatosis does not lead to CT hyperdensity; however, there may be T2 hypointensity and susceptibility artefact on gradient echo sequences secondary to the paramagnetic effects of iron. The anterior pituitary, choroid plexus and pineal gland are all common sites of deposition. Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (previously called Hallervorden-Spatz syndrome) also causes brain iron accumulation leading to T2 hypointensity in the globus pallidi and substantia nigra with associated susceptibility artefact. The characteristic sign is referred to as ‘eye of the tiger’. Menke’s disease is a multisystem disorder leading to copper deficiency. The imaging appearances may be secondary to intracranial haemorrhage caused by tortuous vessels or parenchymal changes with volume loss and T1 basal ganglia hyperintensity. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) causes atrophy and characteristic T2 hyperintensity in the cortex, white matter, putamen, caudate and posterior thalamus leading to the ‘hockey stick’ and ‘pulvinar’ signs",

    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Paget’s disease",
    "explanation": "Paget’s disease has various phases. The initial lytic phase leads to bone resorption followed by laying down of abnormal bone with coarsened trabeculae and then later sclerosis predominates. Paget’s disease typically affects the skull, pelvis, spine and long bones. The skull lesions described in the question are in keeping with osteoporosis circumscripta and are usually well-defined without a sclerotic margin. The humeral lesion which is extending along the cortex is consistent with the ‘blade of grass’ sign which describes a lucent leading edge when Paget’s affects long bones. During the lucent phase of Paget’s disease there is often increased tracer uptake on nuclear medicine bone scan due to the osteoblastic activity. Fibrous dysplasia typically causes a ‘ground glass’ appearance within the bones rather than lysis. With myeloma there would usually be more diffuse skull and skeletal lytic lesions causing a ‘raindrop’ appearance when affecting the skull. Metastatic disease is possible, although again, more diffuse lesions may be expected; the distal long bones are also not typically affected initially. When there is malignant vertebral body marrow infiltration the uptake on nuclear medicine bone scan would usually be focal rather than the diffuse uptake described. Similarly, the peripheral uptake in the skull lesions is typical for osteoporosis circumscripta. Langerhans cell histiocytosis can cause lytic skull lesions but is not typical in this age group and lesions also tend to have bevelled, sclerotic margins",

In 50% of cases there is a central scar which is T2 hyperintense and shows delayed enhancement. Unlike adenoma, FNH is composed of normal liver tissue containing Kupffer cells. Therefore, they will show increased uptake of Tc99m and hepatobiliary specific contrast agents in sulphur colloid and MRI scans respectively. FNH is also typically smaller (<5 cm) than an adenoma; the latter can be very large at presentation. Adenomas are lipid rich and therefore often demonstrate T1 hyperintensity, similarly if it has been complicated by acute haemorrhage there will be foci of high T1 signal.

This often presents with flank pain and haematuria. It is usually bilateral except in ascending infection or renal vein thrombosis and causes include sickle cell disease, tuberculosis, NSAID use and diabetes. Indinavir, associated with antiretroviral drugs used in HIV treatment, is one cause of radiolucent calculi; however there are no other features of this in the case. Acute tubular necrosis can cause debris in the collecting system but the history is usually one of an ischaemic or nephrotoxic event preceding its development. Ultrasound can demonstrate enlarged echogenic kidneys and if contrast is administered for a CT or IVU there may be a persistent nephrogram with minimal or absent filling of the collecting system. Pyonephrosis usually presents with fever. Imaging can demonstrate layered echogenic/high density debris and/or gas within the collecting system. There may be perinephric stranding and renal abscess.

    "explanation": "Herpes simplex encephalitis is the most common cause of viral encephalitis. The typical features are bilateral temporal lobe involvement; however this can be asymmetrical, and involvement of the insular cortex, cingulate gyrus and frontal lobes is also common. There is frequently T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity involving the white matter and cortex and low T1 signal due to oedema. Areas of haemorrhage may develop, which will be high on T1 and low on T2 sequences. There is often restricted diffusion and gyral and leptomeningeal enhancement. Encephalitis caused by other viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, can have similar imaging appearances; however, they are much less likely as HSV accounts for 90% of all viral encephalitis. Autoimmune encephalitis is one differential; however, haemorrhage is more common in HSV encephalitis and sparing of the basal ganglia is also more suggestive of HSV. Neurosyphilis is usually seen in association with HIV infection and can cause bacterial meningitis, encephalitis or arteritis leading to infarcts, often in the brainstem, basal ganglia and middle cerebral artery territory. HSV encephalitis is much more common and the distribution of signal changes in this case is typical for HSV encephalitis. Middle cerebral territory infarcts are sometimes a differential for the changes associated with HSV encephalitis due to the territory involved; however, the bilateral abnormalities in this case and the sparing of the basal ganglia are less consistent with infarct.

The cause is thought to be secondary to a ruptured benign or malignant appendiceal or ovarian mucinous tumor. Calcifications may be associated with tuberculosis; however, the ascites associated with tuberculosis tends to have a higher density. The patient does not have any past medical history, such as previous peritoneal dialysis or a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, to suggest sclerosing peritonitis is likely, and the calcification associated with this tends to be extensive. Peritoneal mesothelioma is rare and is not associated with large volume ascites. There is frequently evidence of pleural calcification as peritoneal calcification can be variable.

    "answer": "Bronchogenic cyst",
    "explanation": "Bronchogenic cysts are often solitary and asymptomatic. They typically have thin non-enhancing walls lined with respiratory epithelium and have a density similar to water, although this can be slightly higher depending on protein content. The subcarinal location is common but they can be anywhere adjacent to the trachea, and occasionally within the lungs themselves. A lymph node does not have a wall. Usually there is cortex surrounding a fatty hilum, although abnormal nodes can become more rounded, necrotic and lose normal architecture. Unless necrotic, the density would usually be closer to soft tissue density and there may be enhancement following contrast administration. Enteric cysts are uncommon, and compared to bronchogenic cysts have thick walls lined with gastrointestinal epithelium and are intimately related to the oesophagus. They can become symptomatic due to peptic ulceration, infection and haemorrhage. Neurenteric cysts occur in the posterior rather than the middle mediastinum, between the oesophagus and spine, and are typically closely related to the spine.

    "answer": "Main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm",
    "explanation": "Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) is a mucin-producing tumour that arises from the epithelium of the main pancreatic duct or a branch. The factors that suggest that this is a main duct IPMN are the dilatation of the pancreatic duct and pancreatic atrophy. These features are less common in branch duct IPMN. The enhancing solid nodule is suspicious for malignancy, which again is more common in main duct IPMN. Cystic lesions communicating directly with the main pancreatic duct suggest a branch duct IPMN. The mucinous secretions are high signal on T2 (aggregations of mucin can mimic the tumour itself and are low signal on T2). Mucinous and serous cystadenoma do not communicate with the main pancreatic duct. Mucinous cystadenomas are more common in the pancreatic body and tail than the head, whereas serous cystadenomas have a more even distribution throughout the pancreas. Calcification can be a feature of both lesions; mucinous lesions tend to have calcification peripherally, whereas serous lesions have central calcification. The history is not typical for an insulinoma, which usually presents early due to hypoglycaemia",

It is often an incidental finding and is due to previous childhood infectious bronchiolitis. Radiographic findings are that of a hyperlucent lung with reduced lung markings and normal or small volume lung and hilum on the affected side. On HRCT there is also bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening. Poland syndrome is a congenital unilateral absence of the pectoralis major and minor muscles which causes increased transradiancy of the hemithorax. There may also be associated chest wall deformity. This is within the differentials for this case; however, it is a comparatively rare condition and not associated with the paucity of vascular markings and small hilum. Large pulmonary embolus may cause the imaging features of reduced lung markings. The ‘Westermark’ sign is a radiographic sign of focal increased lucency of the lung, thought to be secondary to occlusion of the pulmonary artery or due to vasoconstriction distal to the embolus. This sign is not commonly seen and the patient in the main stem is asymptomatic. Hyperlucency due to rotation occurs in the same hemithorax as the direction of rotation and so this cannot account for the findings in this stem. Pneumothorax is also an important consideration; however absent lung markings would be expected as well as presence of a lung edge",

Bilateral haemorrhage can cause adrenal insufficiency, a life-threatening condition unless steroids are given. Haemorrhage can mature to a cystic lesion and become calcified. Adrenal laceration occurs less commonly than adrenal haemorrhage, when it occurs the right adrenal gland is most commonly affected, due to compression of the gland between the liver and the spine.

A study published in the June 2018 Clinical Radiology journal by X-W Wang et al. considered features which may be useful in predicting invasive adenocarcinoma (ICA) compared to adenocarcinoma in-situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA). There is emerging evidence to suggest that AIS and MIA may be able to undergo sublobar resection instead of lobectomy (an important consideration in the elderly or those with bilateral ground glass nodules), whereas IAC requires lobectomy. Thus presurgical assessment of the nodule is required. This study reports that the most powerful predictor of IAC over AIS or MIA is nodule mass. Mass can be calculated using computer-aided measurement, which considers nodule volume as well as CT attenuation value. Nodule volume and diameter were also found to be statistically significant predictor of IAC; however less powerful than mass, as they do not consider internal attenuation.

The relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) may be slightly raised with lymphoma but not to the same degree as a glioblastoma. Differentiating ring enhancing lesions is important on an MRI brain. Tumefactive multiple sclerosis is an important differential in a patient with other signs of MS; however, unlike in this case, the rim of enhancement is usually incomplete and rCBF is usually reduced. Intracranial abscesses would usually have restricted diffusion centrally and this is a useful differentiating factor between them and other pathologies. rCBF is also usually reduced compared to glioblastoma.

All can be associated with renal anomalies and therefore it is important to always assess the kidneys too. The most common anomaly is an arcuate uterus which is considered a normal variant. There is mild indentation of the endometrium at the fundus. This is not thought to have an impact on the ability to conceive or maintain a pregnancy. A septate uterus is caused by the incomplete resorption of the uterovaginal septum and the septum can be ‘partial’ or ‘complete’, extending to either the internal or external os. The external fundal contour of the uterus helps to differentiate a bicornuate from a septate uterus. A bicornuate uterus has a septum too; however, in contrast to a septate uterus it cannot be resected due to the risk of uterine perforation. Uterus didelphys is complete duplication of the uterine horns leading to two separate uterine cavities and cervices. A unicornuate uterus is where there is just one uterine horn and fallopian tube and there may be a rudimentary horn on the contralateral side. Renal anomalies are most common with this subtype. Uterine agenesis is when the uterus has not formed at all and the upper two-thirds of the vagina will also be absent; however, the ovaries and fallopian tubes may or may not be present",

    "answer": "Diaphragmatic rupture",
    "explanation": "Diaphragmatic rupture is often missed on trauma imaging and coronal and sagittal reformats can aid identification. The left hemidiaphragm is more commonly affected due to the protective effects of the adjacent liver on the right hemidiaphragm. The deviation of the nasogastric tube on the chest radiograph is commonly seen due to the stomach herniating through the defect into the left hemithorax. The left hemidiaphragm will be poorly defined or discontinuous. On CT, the ‘collar’ sign describes the constriction of the stomach or other viscera as they herniate through the defect. Sometimes the herniated viscera can also be seen dependently against the posterior ribs. In aortic rupture there would normally be mediastinal widening and other signs such as a left apical cap and left pleural effusion. Although this patient would be at risk from fat embolus due to the femoral fracture, the opacities associated with fat embolism tend to appear after around 48 hours, with normal initial radiographic appearances. Radiographic appearances of tracheobronchial rupture would include pneumothorax and/or pneumomediastinum with the ‘fallen lung’ sign – the affected lung descends dependently within the chest due to the airway discontinuity.

A gallbladder polyp will be within the gallbladder rather than in the ducts and will not demonstrate posterior acoustic shadowing.

The most concerning microcalcification is clustered, pleomorphic (varying in size and shape) or if it is in a ductal distribution with a branching linear pattern. The correct answer in this case describes this type of calcification, extending towards the nipple. Bilateral scattered coarse calcification is commonly seen; the coarse appearance and bilateral distribution is reassuring. Calcification with a layered appearance on the MLO view is consistent with ‘tea-cupping’ and is seen in fibrocystic change.

Later, the lobe becomes hyperlucent with contralateral mediastinal shift. Bronchial atresia can have similar appearances, but the absence of a mucous plug makes CLO the more likely option.

Furthermore, enhancement in tumefactive multiple sclerosis is usually described as an open, rather than a complete ring. Metastases and toxoplasmosis, whilst often ring enhancing, very rarely involve the corpus callosum and cross the midline",

    "stem": "A 72 year old female patient with right lower limb intermittent claudication has a CT angiogram of her lower limbs which identifies widespread vascular calcification with a short tight stenosis of her right common iliac artery. The patient is prepared for an interventional radiology procedure to stent the stenotic segment. Endovascular access is straightforward and the stenosis is confirmed with digital subtraction angiography. Following positioning of the stent and dilatation of the stenosis, the patient’s blood pressure suddenly drops and the patient becomes tachycardic.\nWhat is the most appropriate immediate management?",
    "options": [
      "CT angiogram of the lower limbs",
      "Deploy embolisation coils at the site of the stenosis",
      "Re-inflate the balloon at the site of stenosis",
      "Re-inflate the balloon proximal to the stenosis",
      "Remove the vascular access sheath, wire and balloon"
    ],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Re-inflate the balloon proximal to the stenosis",
    "explanation": "The concern following sudden drop in blood pressure and tachycardia is one of rupture of the right common iliac artery causing significant pelvic haemorrhage. The most appropriate immediate management is to inflate the balloon just proximal to the stenosis which has just been dilated, and presumably the site of the haemorrhage. Once the patient is stabilised and the site confirmed with digital subtraction angiogram, then a covered stent could be deployed to cover the defect. A CT angiogram of the lower limbs would take too long to organise and moving an anaesthetised patient to the CT scanner quickly could waste precious time. The cause can be both confirmed and treated in the interventional radiology suite, so it is more appropriate the patient stays where she is. Embolisation coils are used to treat haemorrhage, but they would not be routinely used for this indication and there would be significant risk of distal ischaemia where there is not good collateralisation. Removing the vascular access sheath, wire and balloon would be contraindicated as maintaining vascular access is essential to treat this complication",

Her GP refers her for transplant follow-up and the patient has an outpatient renal ultrasound. This identifies the transplant kidney in the right iliac fossa. There is a 10-mm upper pole simple renal cyst and no hydronephrosis. There is good global perfusion of the kidney with an arterial resistive index of 0.6 and forward flow in diastole. Normal colour Doppler flow is evident in the renal vein. There is a 50-mm avascular, thin-walled, anechoic structure which appears separate from, but adjacent to, the kidney.\nBased on the imaging characteristics, what is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "options": ["Abscess", "Haematoma", "Lymphocele", "Seroma", "Urinoma"],
    "response": "",
    "answer": "Lymphocele",
    "explanation": "The lesion has features of a simple cystic structure which, along with the history of a well patient, would make abscess unlikely. A haematoma would typically have more complex features, possibly with internal echoes, septations and layering of debris. Haematomas are also more likely in the immediate postoperative period and resolution would be expected after 3 years. A seroma could have similar appearances to the collection described in this case; however, this should also have regressed over a period of 3 years. The main differential lies between urinoma and lymphocele. Lymphocele fits the description and they are the most common cause of a perirenal post-transplant collection. They can persist for a long time following renal transplant and may be asymptomatic or cause compression of surrounding structures. A urinoma is frequently secondary to anastomotic failure or ischaemia. They have fewer septations than haematomas and they frequently contour the renal outline due to the intimate relationship with the urinary tract",

The anomaly is a segment of lung with no communication to the pulmonary arteries or bronchial tree. The most common type is intralobar. This is supplied from the descending thoracic aorta and drains via the pulmonary venous system. Intralobar sequestration is enclosed in visceral pleura. It does not have any associated conditions. In contrast to this, extralobar sequestration is associated with other conditions such as duplication cysts and cardiac anomalies. The segment has its own pleura.

Lymphoma is the most likely correct answer in this case. Hodgkin’s lymphoma is more commonly a cause for enlarged lymph nodes than non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The posterior mediastinum is not frequently involved; however, it is an important site for recurrence of disease, as it may not be included in the radiotherapy field. The presence of nodular interlobular septal thickening raises the possibility of lymphatic infiltration causing lymphangitis carcinomatosis, although this is rare",

    "explanation": "Neurocysticerosis is characterised by cysts at the grey−white matter junction and in the subarachnoid and intraventricular spaces. When intraventricular, they can affect the fourth ventricle and lead to hydrocephalus. The appearances of the cysts can vary depending on the life cycle of the larvae, and as they die can enhance. Breakdown of the cyst membrane leads to surrounding oedema. Calcification is seen in chronic cases. Intracranial toxoplasmosis and cryptococcus infection are not common unless a patient is immunocompromised, and there is no history to suggest this. Toxoplasmosis does also cause ring-enhancing lesions and they can have a similar distribution, affecting the corticomedullary junction as well as the basal ganglia. Cryptococcus has non-specific imaging features, although one described feature is prominent perivascular spaces and ring-enhancing cryptococcomas. Cerebral hydatid cysts often lie in the territory of the middle cerebral artery and are usually solitary. Enhancement and surrounding oedema is not typical unless there is superadded infection. Another differential for these appearances is intracranial tuberculosis infection causing tuberculomas at the corticomedullary junction. These may also enhance peripherally and cause surrounding oedema. The other features of an intraventricular lesion and hydrocephalus are more consistent with neurocysticercosis",
