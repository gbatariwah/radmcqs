      stem: "A 64 year old female patient presents with shortness of breath on exertion. She smokes five cigarettes per day and her past medical history includes rheumatoid arthritis, hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia and atrial fibrillation. Initial bloods are normal apart from the arterial blood gas, which reveals a PaO2 of 9.5 kPa (normal range 10.5–13.5 kPa) with a restrictive pattern on spirometry. High resolution CT chest demonstrates bilateral hyperdense consolidation which is predominantly peripheral, affecting the bases more than the apices with patchy ground glass opacification and reticulation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "Non-specific interstitial pneumonia",
        "Gold induced lung toxicity",
      ],
      answer: "Amiodarone lung disease",
      explanation: "Amiodarone lung disease commonly presents with shortness of breath on exertion caused by hypoxia. The hyperdense consolidation is typical and the distribution is often asymmetrical and peripheral. It can occur 1–12 months following a treatment course of ≥6 months. Other features include a hyperdense liver and heart.\nEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis can cause peripheral consolidation however, it causes serum eosinophilia and this patient’s blood tests are normal. It also tends to present in a younger age group than this patient, around the third to fourth decade. Patients often present with asthma but can also suffer with sinusitis, diarrhoea and arthralgia.\nSimple pulmonary eosinophilia would also cause serum eosinophilia and although can cause peripheral fleeting ground glass opacification would not cause a restrictive pattern on spirometry.\nUsual interstitial pneumonia is more commonly associated with rheumatoid arthritis compared to non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). NSIP can cause predominantly basal and subpleural ground glass opacification. Hyperdense consolidation is not a feature.\nThe treatment of rheumatoid arthritis with gold has reduced over the years due to the introduction of newer agents, and gold-induced lung toxicity is uncommon and would not cause the hyperdense consolidation typical of amiodarone lung disease",

      ],
      answer: "Tear of the triangular fibrocartilage complex",
      explanation: "Positive ulnar variance is a condition in which the ulnar-carpal articulation is more distal than the radial-carpal articulation. The condition causes pain and can result in ulnar impaction syndrome. Ulnar impaction syndrome occurs due to degenerative changes and causes thinning of the triangular fibrocartilage, which is then more easily torn.\nThis is a separate entity to ulnar impingement syndrome, which occurs due to a shortened ulnar (negative ulnar variance). In ulnar impingement syndrome, radioulnar convergence causes impingement of the distal ulnar on the distal radius, proximal to the sigmoid notch. After a prolonged period of time, subchondral sclerosis and scalloping of the distal radius at the distal radio-ulnar joint may be seen.\nAvascular necrosis of the lunate bone, also known as Kienböck disease, is more associated with negative ulnar variance",

        "Serous microcystic adenoma",
      ],
      answer: "Mucinous cystic neoplasm",
      explanation: "There are certain features that can help to differentiate between pancreatic tumours.\nThe description of this lesion fits with a mucinous cystic neoplasm: The patient is middle-aged and the mass is large and cystic, containing only a couple of cysts, and it is located in the pancreatic tail. There is peripheral calcification and no connection with the pancreatic duct.\nSerous microcystic adenoma classically affects elderly, usually female, patients. In contrast to mucinous cystic neoplasms, they favour the pancreatic head. They are made up of innumerable small cysts, and calcification tends to be centrally located. They also do not have a connection to the main pancreatic duct.\nDuctal adenocarcinoma is the most common type of pancreatic cancer and is solid and usually hypodense compared to the adjacent enhancing pancreas. Due to non-specific symptoms and subsequent late presentation, regional lymph node enlargement and metastases are not unusual findings.\nIntraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms are thin-walled cysts which have a connection with the pancreatic duct. They can be split into branch or main duct lesions. Branch duct lesions often resemble a bunch of grapes and the main duct subtype causes pancreatic duct dilatation. Neither usually contain calcification.\nNeuroendocrine tumours of the pancreas are also called islet cell tumours, and insulinomas are most common. They are also usually solid tumours and hypervascular",

      stem: "A 12 year old boy is referred for a chest radiograph. He has recurrent pulmonary infections and shortness of breath on exertion. The radiograph shows a small right lung with ipsilateral mediastinal shift. There is a curvilinear tubular opacity adjacent to the heart border. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "Unilateral absence of the pulmonary artery",
      ],
      answer: "Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return",
      explanation: "Scimitar or hypogenetic lung syndrome is a form of PAPVR. It is characterised by a hypoplastic right lung with an anomalous vein that drains the abnormal right lung segment into the systemic venous system. Most commonly, the anomalous vein drains into the inferior vena cava giving rise to the curvilinear tubular opacity described on radiographs. However, it can also drain into other structures including the right atrium, hepatic veins or portal vein. Its arterial supply can be variable.\nThe description in this case is typical for scimitar syndrome; however, pulmonary sequestration also has alternative vascular supply with both intra- and extralobar types deriving their arterial supply from the systemic arteries. Intralobar sequestration has a pulmonary venous drainage, whereas extralobar drains into the systemic veins. Neither have a connection with the bronchial tree.\nUnilateral absence of the pulmonary artery is characterised by a small affected lung with oligaemia and contralateral lung compensatory over inflation. However, the tubular opacity adjacent to the right heart border is not consistent with this diagnosis.\nTetralogy of Fallot is not associated with the findings in this case. The typical finding is a boot-shaped heart, pulmonary oligaemia, and a right-sided aortic arch may be present.\nRight middle lobe atelectasis may look similar with opacity adjacent to the right heart border, but the other findings are more consistent with scimitar syndrome",

      stem: "An MRI whole spine of a 53 year old man reveals a solitary thoracic spinal cord lesion. It is intradural and has both an intramedullary and extramedullary component which is extending posteriorly. It extends inferiorly over 1–2 segments. It is well defined, low T1 signal and predominantly high T2 signal apart from very low T2 signal at its caudal margin. It has a small, rounded, enhancing soft tissue component and flow voids. There is high STIR signal in the surrounding cord. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "Haemangioblastoma",
        "Meningioma",
      ],
      answer: "Haemangioblastoma",
      explanation: "Haemangioblastoma are most common in the thoracic and cervical spine. They are usually intramedullary and can have an extramedullary component. Characteristic features include a well-defined mass which is cystic containing an enhancing solid nodule. Flow voids can be evident in larger lesions and there can be a haemosiderin cap which manifests as very low T2 signal, as described in this case at the lesion’s caudal aspect.\nArteriovenous malformations will also demonstrate flow voids and potentially high T2 cord signal in the cord due to oedema, as well as prominent feeding or draining vessels. However, the cystic and soft tissue component of the mass is not typical.\nThe main two differentials for intramedullary cord lesions include ependymoma and astrocytoma. Ependymomas are similar in that they can exhibit a haemosiderin cap and are usually well-defined. However, they most commonly affect the cervical spine and are also frequently described in the filum terminale. They tend to affect three to four segments.\nAstrocytomas are most common in the paediatric population and more frequently occur in the thoracic spine. In contrast to the lesion in this case, they are usually ill-defined and more infiltrative. They also usually extend over more than four segments.\nMeningiomas are solid lesions which are usually extramedullary, unlike the lesion in this case. They can sometimes be low on T1 and T2 if they are calcified",

The CT shows volume loss in the lower lung zones. There is extensive honeycomb destruction of the lungs, predominantly in the dependent aspect of the lower zones but also at the lateral and anterior aspect of the mid and lower zones. The airways within the abnormal looking lung demonstrate traction dilatation. There is minimal ground glass opacification in both lungs. The upper and mid zones of the lung demonstrate mild background emphysematous change. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "Respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease",
        "Usual interstitial pneumonia",
      ],
      answer: "Usual interstitial pneumonia",
      explanation: "The CT description provided is that of a fibrotic lung process and is typical of a UIP pattern of disease. A UIP pattern of disease is associated with predominantly honeycomb destruction of the lung which has an apicobasal gradient and tends to be peripheral.\nGround glass opacification is the predominant finding in non-specific interstitial pneumonia.\nThe imaging findings of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis can overlap significantly with UIP pattern. However, the fibrosis distribution is more typically basal and peripheral in UIP, whereas in hypersensitivity pneumonitis the fibrotic change is less likely to be peripheral and is typically upper zones, although all zones can be affected. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may also be associated with mosaicism secondary to air trapping.\nThe predominant imaging finding in cryptogenic organising pneumonia is ground glass change and dense consolidation. Respiratory bronchiolitis−associated interstitial lung disease represents a spectrum of disease associated with smokers. The findings on CT chest are more typically centred on the airways with airway wall thickening and evidence of air trapping. There may be small centrilobular nodules which represent occlusion of the small airways",

      options: ["Breast", "Bronchus", "Colon", "Kidney", "Prostate"],
      answer: "Bronchus",
      explanation: "Bone metastases favour the axial skeleton rather than the appendicular skeleton due to the presence of red marrow. The most common malignancy associated with bone metastases is carcinoma of the bronchus. Colon cancer is another cause of lytic bone metastasis. Renal and thyroid malignancies may be associated with lytic, expansile lesions. Breast cancer is a common cause of lytic, mixed lytic/sclerotic and sclerotic bone metastases; however this is much less common in male patients",

        "Smooth stricture in the mid-oesophagus",
      ],
      answer: "Long, linear oesophageal filling defects",
      explanation: "The patient is likely immunocompromised due to the chemotherapy regimen and therefore opportunistic infections such as candida, herpes simplex and cytomegalovirus (CMV) should be considered. Candida oesophagitis is the most common infectious cause, and findings include long linear plaque-like lesions, ulceration and pseudomembrane formation. CMV (and HIV) cause massive ulcers, whereas herpes simplex oesophagitis tends to lead to multiple small ulcers.\nFlask-shaped mucosal outpouchings are typical for pseudo diverticulosis of the oesophagus caused by the mucous glands filling with contrast. It is associated with reflux, strictures and oesophagitis.\nMultiple small nodular oesophageal filling defects are seen in glycogenic acanthosis, a condition associated with the elderly due to glycogen deposition.\nSmooth oesophageal strictures infer benign causes such as previous caustic ingestion, radiation, Barrett oesophagus and skin diseases with oesophageal manifestations, such as epidermolysis bullosa and pemphigoid. A likely cause in a breast oncology patient would be radiation; however, this patient is currently only having neoadjuvant chemotherapy",

This more commonly affects women between the ages of 30 and 50 years and often presents with hypertension. Although the renal arteries are most commonly affected, other sites such as the vertebral, iliac, coeliac and extracranial internal carotid arteries can also be involved. Therefore symptoms including headache, stroke, angina or mesenteric ischaemia are possible, depending on the site of involvement. If asymptomatic, patients are kept under observation but if presenting symptomatically the condition is amenable to angioplasty and responds well. Stenting is rarely required.

Other features include thyroid goitres, skin lesions and gastrointestinal polyps. Although Cowden syndrome and dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma are rare, the answer to this question can also be deduced from knowledge of the other, more common conditions. Ataxia telangiectasia leads to cerebellar atrophy and on imaging low T2 signal foci likely represent haemosiderin deposition secondary to bleeds from abnormal telangiectatic vessels.

      explanation: "It can be difficult to determine the underlying cause of intra-axial lesions on imaging, particularly when differentiating abscess from a malignant process. Abscesses are commonly low on T1, high on T2 and FLAIR sequences with significant adjacent oedema and mass effect. The ring of enhancement is often described as thinner compared to malignancy; however, the sequence that can be most helpful in differentiating the two is DWI and ADC map. The presence of central diffusion restriction favours abscess over a necrotic tumour. The ‘dual rim’ sign may be seen in cases of intracranial abscesses. It is an outer hypointense rim and inner hyperintense rim. This may be appreciated best on T2 and susceptibility weighted imaging. MR perfusion may be helpful as the relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the surrounding oedema of an abscess is usually reduced compared to tumour oedema",

      explanation: "This is the most common cause of limp in children aged 5–10 years. It is of uncertain aetiology, possibly related to viral illness, infection, previous trauma or allergy. Features on ultrasound are that of a joint effusion in the anterior recess without synovial thickening, which resolves after 10–15 days. Developmental dysplasia of the hip is often undetected until adulthood; however, children with risk factors (including breech delivery, oligohydramnios, family history) are now screened. Ultrasound is the test of choice in infants less than 6 months old. On radiographs there may be an abnormal acetabular angle, it should measure less than 22° in children older than 1 year of age. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is associated with synovial hypertrophy and effusion. Septic arthritis is an important consideration; radiographs may be normal in the very acute phase. There may be juxta-articular osteoporosis due to hyperaemia, narrowing of the joint space due to cartilage destruction, as well as destruction of the subchondral bone on both sides of a joint. Spontaneous resolution would not be expected. Slipped upper femoral epiphysis is most commonly seen in those 10–16 years of age.

      explanation: "A duplex kidney does not necessarily imply a complete ureteric duplication; however, with the ultrasound appearances of ureterocele there is suspicion of an ectopic insertion of the upper moiety ureter. Incomplete duplication is when the ureters converge above the level of the bladder and often this can exist with a degree of ‘yo-yo’ reflux from one ureter into the other. When there is complete duplication the upper pole moiety often obstructs due to the presence of a ureterocele. This can cause the ‘drooping lily’ sign due to hydronephrosis and lack of filling of the upper pole moiety and subsequent displacement of the opacifying lower pole moiety. The upper moiety ureter inserts ectopically, often into the urinary bladder, but this can insert into the urethra, vagina or seminal vesicles, potentially causing continuous wetting in older children. The lower moeity ureter inserts normally but is prone to reflux. The Weigert-Meyer rule states that the upper moiety ureter inserts inferomedial to the lower moiety ureter",

Past medical history includes hypertension and gallstones. The GP refers him to the rapid access chest pain clinic.

      answer: "Myocardial infarct involving the left anterior descending artery",
      explanation: "The left anterior descending artery and its branches supply the anterolateral and apical walls of the left ventricle and the interventricular septum. The high T2 weighted signal in this region is secondary to oedema suggesting a relatively acute insult, and the delayed hyperenhancement is typical in infarcted myocardium and tends to be subendocardial or full thickness. Myocardial stunning and hibernation often have similar imaging findings. Stunning is caused following a transient period of ischaemia, whereas hibernation is thought to be related to more chronic ischaemia where the myocardial cells adapt to reduced perfusion by hibernating and reducing metabolic activity. Both these conditions lead to impaired function, manifesting as reduced contractility. Stunned myocardium tends to have preserved perfusion whereas it can be reduced in myocardial hibernation. Acute myocarditis may demonstrate increased myocardial T2 weighted signal however other findings such as a focal area of wall motion abnormality would also be expected. Enhancement in myocarditis tends to involve the epicardium and be early rather than the delayed subendocardial enhancement described in this case",

Sometimes this vascularity can be described in association with ectopic pregnancies; however, these are usually extra-adnexal and not within the ovary. The anechoic, avascular lesions on the contralateral ovary likely represent follicles and are physiological. In premenopausal women simple ovarian cysts <5 cm do not require follow-up. If they are larger than this, then follow-up in at least 6 weeks (at a different phase in the menstrual cycle) is suggested. In postmenopausal women, follow-up of cysts >3 cm is suggested.

Duodenal rupture is suggested if there is retroperitoneal free gas, wall thickening, discontinuity of the wall, adjacent free fluid and fat stranding. This requires surgical management and may be associated with other intra-abdominal injuries. In the context of trauma, duodenal wall thickening and a heterogenous soft tissue attenuation mass adjacent to the duodenum without any evidence of perforation would be in keeping with a duodenal haematoma. This is usually managed conservatively unless there is evidence of active haemorrhage.

The first and second ribs do not become notched because the first and second posterior intercostal arteries arise from the costocervical trunk, a branch of the subclavian artery. They therefore do not communicate with the aorta and so are not involved in collateral formation. Rib notching commonly affects the third to ninth ribs bilaterally due to the coarctation being distal to both subclavian arteries. If there is unilateral right rib notching, as in this case, then the coarctation lies distal to the brachiocephalic trunk but proximal to the origin of the left subclavian artery, or there may be a right sided aortic arch with aberrant left subclavian artery which is distal to the coarctation",

This typically develops in premature infants with severe surfactant deficiency causing respiratory distress syndrome. Surfactant deficiency is associated with reduced lung volumes. Artificial ventilation can cause air to track into the interstitial space causing pneumothoraces. Air can also track centrally and cause pneumomediastinum. The appearance of the thymus in this case is consistent with pneumomediastinum, with surrounding air and displacement of the thymic lobes laterally. Both pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum are important complications to recognise and inform the clinical team about promptly. The main differential is bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which is an acquired condition, also associated with ventilated premature infants. It usually occurs more gradually than PIE.

There is associated restricted diffusion but no enhancement. The characteristic feature is elevated N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA). Adrenoleukodystrophy is X-linked, affecting young male patients. It classically has a posterior distribution affecting the occipitoparietal region, particularly the periventricular area. There is involvement of the splenium of the corpus callosum. Peripheral enhancement is frequently seen. Alexander disease has a predominantly anterior distribution which progresses posteriorly and becomes more diffuse during the course of the disease. It causes abnormal white matter T2 hyperintensity and enhancement. NAA is normal. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher is also X-linked and causes subcortical white matter abnormalities. There is usually cerebellar atrophy. Importantly, the perivascular regions are usually spared, which leads to ‘tigroid’ appearance, similar to metachromatic leukodystrophy. NAA is usually reduced. Krabbe disease favours a more periventricular distribution and causes abnormal MRI signal in a more central and posterior position. It also leads to optic nerve hypertrophy",

Linitis plastica can have multiple causes including malignancy, inflammation and infection. The most common cause is scirrhous adenocarcinoma of the stomach. This often causes submucosal infiltration and hence endoscopic biopsies are frequently negative; therefore a repeat may not yield any further information. The lung nodules are relatively small for biopsy and the lower lobe location can also make biopsy more challenging due to diaphragmatic respiratory motion. US guided liver biopsy could be considered; however with moderate ascites this would be relatively contraindicated due to risk of haemorrhage, and drainage should be considered first. The peritoneal nodules are superficial and may be amenable to ultrasound guided biopsy. Colonoscopy would not be helpful in this scenario",

      answer: "Congenital pulmonary airway malformation",
      explanation: "CPAM, previously known as congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, is a hamartomatous lesion of the lung most commonly causing a mass composed of multiple large cysts (type I). Detected either antenatally or in neonates with respiratory distress, these lesions initially are fluid filled and then, due to their connection with the bronchial tree, fill with air. Their appearance therefore changes to contain air-fluid levels. types II and III are less common, type II are multiple smaller cysts and type III has microscopic cysts and therefore the lesions appear solid. A bronchogenic cyst has no connection with the bronchial tree and therefore would not typically contain air-fluid levels (unless complicated, e.g. by infection). As the name suggests, congenital lobar overinflation (CLO) causes significant hyperinflation of a lung lobe. Although fluid may be in the lung initially following birth, there is no cystic component in CLO. It also most commonly affects the left upper and right middle lobes, whereas CPAM has no lobar predilection. Diaphragmatic hernias may contain air-fluid levels if they contain bowel loops and, if large, they can lead to respiratory distress. However, large diaphragmatic hernias are usually left-sided Bochdalek hernias and not right sided, as in this case. Pulmonary sequestration can present with a multiloculated cystic mass; however, it is most common in the left lower lobe and has a systemic arterial supply which the lesion in this case does not have. The vascular drainage of pulmonary sequestration helps to differentiate between the intra or extra lobar subtypes",

On MRI there is T1 hypointensity and T2 and FLAIR hyperintensity with restricted diffusion. The caudate, putamen and thalamus can also be involved. Methanol poisoning classically affects the putamen causing putaminal necrosis. It can also lead to retinal and optic disc necrosis and generalised cerebral oedema. The distribution also differs in hypoglycaemic encephalopathy which causes signal abnormality in the posterior limb of the internal capsules, basal ganglia, hippocampi and cerebral cortex. Anoxic brain injury would likely cause more widespread changes involving other grey matter structures such as the cortex, thalami and cerebellum and leading to diffuse cerebral oedema and effacement of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces. Lead poisoning is unusual, and the history is usually one of prolonged excessive exposure leading to neurological decline, psychiatric symptoms and anaemia. Cyanide and manganese poisoning can particularly affect the globus pallidi; however, both of these diagnoses would be far more unusual than carbon monoxide poisoning",

      answer: "Renal vein thrombosis",
      explanation: "There is reverse flow in diastole on the arterial trace which is consistent with renal vein thrombosis; flow should always be flowing forwards even in diastole. The typical presentation is with tenderness and decreased urine output in the first week following transplant. The kidney can appear swollen and can be hypoechoic on ultrasound. The renal vessels can be difficult to clearly visualise immediately following transplant depending on position and body habitus. If the renal vein could be visualised and assessed with Doppler, there would be no venous flow. Renal artery thrombosis is also an early complication but thankfully quite rare. There would be no vascularity on the ultrasound Doppler, and diagnosis is imperative as it requires prompt return to theatre to try and salvage the graft. Pseudoaneurysm formation, rejection and renal artery stenosis are late complications. Pseudoaneurysms usually form as a result of biopsy, not due to the transplant surgery itself. On Doppler ultrasound there will be a focus of abnormal colour flow with very turbid flow. Rejection is also a late complication. Typically the kidney is enlarged with large renal pyramids and reduced corticomedullary differentiation. The resistive index tends to be high and there can be mild pelvicalyceal dilatation. Features of renal artery stenosis on ultrasound Doppler include increased resistive indices (>0.7) and a parvus-tardus wave form, in contrast to the sharp upstroke seen in a normal transplant trace.

The homogenous durally based lesion is consistent with a meningioma in Neurofibromatosis (NF) 2 and the T2 hyperintense deep white matter lesions are typical for focal areas of signal intensity (FASI) which are seen in NF1",

      answer: "Mesenteric panniculitis",
      explanation: "This is a rare, chronic inflammation of small bowel mesenteric fat. Typically on CT it manifests as a well-defined mesenteric root mass with a ‘misty’ appearance and surrounding fat halo. Classically it envelops but does not distort the mesenteric vessels and does not involve the bowel. It has a predilection for the jejunal mesentery. The finding of a low-attenuation fat halo surrounding the vessels is highly suggestive of mesenteric panniculitis. Carcinoid tumours can present with similar symptoms but they are centred on the bowel, most commonly the terminal ileum. However, they can cause significant desmoplastic reaction in the adjacent mesentery. Radiation enteritis is not possible without significant medical history and usually causes mural thickening and luminal narrowing. The bowel in this case is unaffected. Tuberculosis usually affects the terminal ileum and caecum rather than the mesenteric root and can also cause characteristic low attenuation lymph node enlargement. Mesenteric lipoma are unusual and would be uniformly fat attenuation rather than the heterogenous misty appearance associated with mesenteric panniculitis",

      explanation: "The location and appearance is consistent with an oligodendroglioma. These most commonly occur between 30 and 50 years of age. They are commonly located in the frontal lobe and the majority contain calcification. Enhancement is very variable and they can erode adjacent bone; both are features which can help to differentiate them from meningiomas. Meningiomas homogenously enhance and can cause adjacent hyperostosis but not erosion. Astrocytomas can have variable appearances depending on their grade, from low grade pilocytic astrocytomas in children, to high grade anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). Unlike this lesion, they usually cause mass effect, and calcification is uncommon. Adjacent bone erosion is also not a typical feature. GBM is aggressive and infiltrative with significant adjacent oedema and enhancement. The location of this lesion is not typical for an ependymoma. They arise from glial cells lining the ventricles or spinal canal. In children they are usually infratentorial affecting the fourth ventricle, but they can be supratentorial in adults",

      answer: "Post-embolisation syndrome",
      explanation: "Post-embolisation syndrome is thought to be an immune-mediated response that can occur following chemoembolisation, for example in liver lesions or following arterial embolisation procedures such as uterine artery embolisation. Symptoms include fever, nausea, and pain and they usually peak around 48 hours post procedure and then improve within a week. Gas within a recently embolised lesion is relatively common and this does not necessarily infer infection. With endometritis, the endometrium would be thickened with other findings including fluid and/or gas in the endometrial cavity and increased vascularity. Fibroid torsion is uncommon and is associated with pedunculated subserosal fibroids. It can present with pain; however uterine artery embolisation does not predispose to this and the most likely diagnosis in this case remains post-embolisation syndrome. Non-target organ ischaemia can occur as a complication following any embolisation procedure but the most common organs affected by this are the ovaries rather than the uterus. Normal uterine tissue tolerates the ischaemia induced by uterine artery embolisation compared to fibroids",

      explanation: "The question describes a pathological fracture through a Brown tumour of the distal radius. These are lytic expansile lesions which are similar to giant cell tumours histologically and can contain fluid-fluid levels on MRI. The other findings of osteosclerosis and subperiosteal resorption of the phalanges are typical for hyperparathyroidism. Brown tumours are historically most commonly attributed to primary hyperparathyroidism, of which the most frequent cause is a parathyroid adenoma. This could be detected with a nuclear medicine 99-Tc-MIBI scan which should reveal the parathyroid adenoma. A pertechnetate thyroid scan investigating for a parathyroid adenoma (e.g. in answer A) would detect a region of decreased tracer uptake compared to the thyroid, rather than increased uptake. In recent times, secondary hyperparathyroidism has become more common, and the most frequent cause of the secondary form of the condition is chronic renal failure, which would manifest with renal cortical thinning. Other causes of secondary hyperparathyroidism include vitamin D deficiency which may lead to Looser zones, a type of insufficiency fracture (described in answer E). The other answers describe Graves disease on a nuclear medicine thyroid scan and liver metastases on a CT abdomen and pelvis, which are not associated with hyperparathyroidism",

This condition also affects patient with colitis of other causes but accounts for the majority of deaths related to ulcerative colitis and should therefore should be kept in mind when reporting acute imaging. Toxic megacolon does not always cause bowel dilatation; however, if the colon is dilated >5 cm, particularly the transverse colon, where gas tends to collect, it should be considered. Colonoscopy and barium studies are contraindicated due to the risk of perforation. Frequent (often daily) abdominal radiographs are suggested to monitor bowel dilatation.

      answer: "Above the urogenital diaphragm",
      explanation: "Signs of urethral injury include inability to void, haematuria and blood at the urethral meatus. The urethra is split into anterior and posterior sections, with anterior being penile and bulbous portions, and posterior being prostatic and membranous. The anterior urethra is more commonly injured in straddle type injuries and the posterior urethra in blunt trauma, sometimes with pelvic fractures. Iatrogenic causes are also important to consider. The Goldman classification helps to distinguish between the different types of injury. The important landmark is the urogenital diaphragm. If the contrast extravasates into the retropubic space it suggests injury above the urogenital diaphragm. Conversely, if the contrast leaks into the perineum it suggests injury below the urogenital diaphragm. Above the urogenital diaphragm relates to the posterior urethra. Incomplete urethral injuries, such as in this case, are often treated conservatively with catheterization; however complete transection may require surgery. Urethral stricture is the most common long-term complication of urethral injury, with post-traumatic strictures tending to be short. Post-infectious strictures are more likely to be long",

Its path takes it between the trachea and oesophagus to reach the left lung, which causes an indentation on the anterior oesophageal wall. It can present in infancy with respiratory distress secondary to right main bronchus compression. The right subclavian artery usually arises from the brachiocephalic trunk. An aberrant right subclavian artery arises directly from the aortic arch after the left subclavian artery and then passes back towards the right side, frequently posterior to the oesophagus and hence can cause an indentation. A double aortic arch also indents the oesophagus posteriorly on a lateral view during a barium swallow; however, on the AP view it creates a ‘reverse S’ appearance.

      explanation: "The acute concern is whether there is a pulmonary embolus, and the patient has not yet had this diagnosis confirmed or excluded. It is possible that suboptimal opacification could occur again; a VQ scan is a sensible alternative. If a VQ scan is not readily available in your hospital, or if the patient is clinically unstable, repeat attempt at CT pulmonary angiogram would be required (although this is not presented as an option in this question). The imaging features described on the CT raise the possibility of pulmonary artery hypertension. An echocardiogram would be very useful in this patient, to look for an underlying chronic left to right shunt (such as an atrial septal defect) as well as mitral valve stenosis. Mosaicism can be assessed further using an expiratory phase CT chest where appropriate. In the case of pulmonary hypertension, the central vessel dilatation is indicative of a vascular cause of mosaicism. Furthermore, the low attenuation foci in the lung associated with small peripheral vessels are abnormal and represent oligaema; on expiratory CT the low attenuation foci will demonstrate an increase in attenuation. CT abdomen and pelvis may be performed in the case of known pulmonary embolus if there is a high clinical suspicion of underlying malignancy.

In homocysteinuria there is frequently generalised osteoporosis and widespread skeletal abnormalities, rather than the quite focal abnormality described in this case. Lens dislocation is a typical feature. There may be sternal abnormalities and the epiphyses and metaphyses are frequently affected. Imaging of the spine may reveal biconcave vertebrae and scoliosis. Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis occurs in patients less than 16 years old. The imaging features may also include a squared patella and widened intercondylar notch. Pigmented villonodular synovitis is a proliferative condition of the synovium with haemosiderin deposition. The radiographic features may include marginal erosions. In primary synovial chondromatosis there is proliferation of the synovium which can cause intra-articular loose bodies; these may or may not calcify. Imaging features in this condition can include soft tissue swelling around the joint and widening of the joint space as well as erosion of the adjacent bone. Multiple calcific densities may be present in the joint space, which are uniform in size",

      answer: "CT chest, abdomen pelvis with arterial and portal venous phase contrast",
      explanation: "Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 1 is associated with proliferative lesions in the pancreas, pituitary and parathyroid glands. MEN 2 is associated with medullary thyroid cancer, parathyroid hyperplasia and phaeochromocytomas. The patient likely has MEN 1, as he has symptoms of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome secondary to a gastrinoma. These commonly occur in the pancreas but are also seen elsewhere, for example in the duodenum. The most appropriate test is a CT, including arterial phase contrast, as the tumours are hypervascular and are most likely to be seen on this phase of imaging. A barium meal would likely reveal features of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, such as thickened gastric folds and erosions/ulcers, but would likely not identify the gastrin-secreting lesion. An MRCP would be more helpful than an MRI small bowel, as the gastrinomas commonly occur in the pancreas. 18F-FDG PET/CT may be helpful in poorly differentiated metastatic disease with neuroendocrine tumours but would not be indicated in this case. A 111In-Octrotide scan may be more helpful in localising the gastrinoma and any metastatic spread. Patients with MEN 1 may also have pituitary lesions which an MRI brain would help to characterise, but in the first instance, the CT would be most helpful",

      ],
      answer: "Pyeloureteritis cystica",
      explanation: "Horseshoe kidneys are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. They are positioned lower than normal and their ascent into the upper abdomen is halted by the inferior mesenteric artery, usually around the level of L3. On ultrasound it may sometimes not be recognised, especially if the lower poles are not well seen and the fusion not appreciated. These abnormally positioned kidneys are more prone to trauma, calculi, pyeloureteritis cystica, transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) and pelviureteric junction obstruction due to poor drainage. TCC is a concern in patients with horseshoe kidneys and potentially in patients with pyeloureteritis cystica due to the chronic inflammation associated with the condition. However, with TCC the lesions would be expected to have a soft tissue density and enhance, although compared to the adjacent renal parenchyma this can be difficult to appreciate. Pyeloureteritis cystica causes multiple small cysts and is often associated with diabetes and recurrent infection. This, along with the impeded drainage that can occur in a horseshoe kidney, further predispose patients to the condition. Multiple calculi are unlikely in the clinical setting of painless haematuria, and the density of these small lesions is not typical for calculi. Leukoplakia is also associated with recurrent infection but is more common in the urinary bladder than the upper tracts. Tuberculous urethritis causes intermittent stricturing and dilatation, as well as urinary tract calcification",

The superior mesenteric vein usually lies to the right of the superior mesenteric artery; in malrotation it lies to the left. The retro-mesenteric D3 part of the duodenum may not be visible between the aorta and superior mesenteric vessels. On fluoroscopy establishing the position of the duodenojejunal (DJ) flexure is key. It should cross the midline to lie to the left of the left vertebral body pedicle at, or above, the level of the duodenal bulb. The caecum may have a normal position even in malrotation; however, a cephalad position of the caecum would be suspicious given the other findings.

Within the cyanotic group another important consideration is whether the lungs are oligaemic or congested. The use of categorisation helps to narrow the differentials. For this child, the presence of cyanosis and oligaemia suggests conditions such as tetralogy of Fallot, Ebstein anomaly or pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum. The presence of a very enlarged heart excludes tetralogy of Fallot, when the heart is usually normal in size but classically described as boot shaped with an elevated apex. Pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum is not an option for this question but can have very similar appearances to Ebstein anomaly. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return causes cyanosis and plethoric lungs. Transposition of the great arteries (the D-transposition subtype) is also a cause of cyanosis, but lung appearance can be variable. It typically cases an ‘egg-on-a-string’ appearance of the mediastinum due to narrowing of the superior mediastinum.

Although many men who have worked in the construction and manufacturing industries are at risk, their family members would have also potentially been exposed to asbestos fibres on their clothing. Round atelectasis can look mass-like − it is caused by collapsed infolded lung adjacent to calcified or non-calcified pleural thickening. Enhancement is a feature because of the presence of lung parenchyma. The bronchovascular crowding and distortion described is known as the ‘comet tail’ sign. Round atelectasis tends to be relatively stable over time but can sometimes demonstrate interval growth. Asbestos exposure can also lead to asbestosis − an interstitial lung disease typically associated with lower zone fibrosis. The other features listed in the question are not associated with round atelectasis. Causes of cavitating pulmonary nodules include tuberculosis, primary or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, abscesses and septic emboli. Intralesional fat and popcorn calcification is typical for a pulmonary hamartoma. The water-lily sign is associated with pulmonary hydatid disease.

      explanation: "Bronchiolitis obliterans is a manifestation of chronic rejection. It usually occurs 6–18 months after transplant, but can occur as early as 3 months. It occurs in approximately 50% of patients and is a major cause of mortality in these patients. Repeated episodes of acute transplant and cytomegalovirus infection are predisposing factors. The radiological features in this condition are that of bronchiectasis: mildly hyperinflated lungs, airway wall thickening and mosaicism (representing air trapping). Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease can occur from 1 month to several years after lung transplantation. It represents lymphoid proliferation (B- or T-cell proliferation) on a spectrum of benign proliferation to high grade lymphoma. It usually occurs after Epstein-Barr viral infection. Radiographically it manifests as single or multiple nodules, less commonly consolidation and hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes. These do not match the description provided in the main stem. The description in the main stem is also not consistent with acute transplant rejection or reperfusion syndrome, as these complications occur in the acute setting. Infection can occur at any time following transplant, however the radiological features described, and the time frame provided is typical for bronchiolitis obliterans",

      explanation: "Horseshoe kidneys are prone to having multiple ectopic renal arteries and therefore a CT angiogram prior to any surgery would be helpful, especially because this patient was diagnosed incidentally on a CT cologram, which is a portal venous phase study. 18F-FDG PET/CT is not routinely indicated in renal cell carcinoma due to limited tracer uptake in renal tumours. Furthermore, the tumour is small with no locoregional nodes so occult metastatic disease is unlikely. Horseshoe kidneys are associated with conditions that can cause urinary tract filling defects such as pyelouretitis cystica and transitional cell carcinoma; however CT urogram is not part of the imaging workup in a renal cell carcinoma diagnosis. Nuclear medicine studies can be very helpful for management planning in the Urology multidisciplinary team meeting, especially if there is concern regarding renal function, because the results of these studies may lead to more conservative surgery being considered.
