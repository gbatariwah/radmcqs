      "stem": "An 81 year old retired ship builder with a pacemaker has a CT pulmonary angiogram for pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath. There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus; however you notice that he has small bilateral pleural effusions and widespread bilateral pleural thickening involving the hemidiaphragms. There are a couple of prominent, but not frankly enlarged, hila nodes. Ultrasound guided pleural biopsy is inconclusive. The clinical team call you asking for advice regarding further imaging to help distinguish malignant from benign pleural thickening. What is the most appropriate test?",

      ],
      "answer": "18F-FDG PET/CT scan",
      "explanation": "18F-FDG PET/CT scan is used to help differentiate benign from malignant pleural thickening and can also help to assess for nodal metastases in malignant mesothelioma. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is not typically used for this indication. CT abdomen and pelvis would be more appropriate once malignancy was confirmed to exclude peritoneal involvement. On MRI, high T2 signal intensity when compared to muscle, and contrast enhancement of the pleural thickening is suggestive of malignancy; however, this patient has a pacemaker which would likely contraindicate MRI. MRI is sometimes used in the staging of malignant mesothelioma, particularly where there is a question regarding surgical resection and the extent of chest wall or diaphragmatic involvement. Portal venous phase contrast CT chest is better at demonstrating pleural enhancement than an arterial phase CT; however, 18F-FDG PET/CT is more sensitive for distinguishing between malignant and benign disease. CT features that favour a malignant process include pleural thickness >1 cm, nodularity and mediastinal pleural involvement",

      "stem": "A 47 year old female patient is reviewed in the rheumatology clinic with joint pains in her hands. Radiographs are requested which demonstrate a bilateral symmetrical arthropathy with osteopenia, reduction in joint space, osteophytosis and flattening of the index and middle finger metacarpal heads. There are subchondral cysts and irregularity of the articular surface which is particularly affecting the metacarpal phalangeal joints and the carpal bones. What other imaging appearance would correspond with these findings?",
      "options": [
        "Dilated oesophagus on chest radiograph",
        "Hyperdensity in the sagittal sinus on CT head",
        "Pancreatic low signal on T1, T2 and T2* sequences on MRI of the upper abdomen",

      ],
      "answer": "Pancreatic low signal on T1, T2 and T2* sequences on MRI of the upper abdomen",
      "explanation": "Haemochromatosis causes a symmetrical arthropathy typically affecting the second and third metacarpal phalangeal joints causing osteopenia, reduction in joint space, subchondral cysts, flattening of the metacarpal heads and ‘hook-like’ osteophytes. Chondrocalcification is common and overlaps with calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystal deposition disease. Haemochromatosis is associated with iron deposition in the liver, spleen, heart, pancreas and central nervous system, causing low signal on T1, T2 and T2* MRI sequences. A dilated oesophagus would be associated with scleroderma – acro-osteolysis causing ‘pencil-in-cup’ deformities; soft tissue atrophy and calcification and contractures are also features. There is often marked ulnar deviation of the phalanges. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes symmetrical muscle wasting, periarticular osteopenia and reversible deformities such as ‘swan-neck’ deformities and ulnar deviation. SLE is associated with hypercoagulability, and patients are at risk of venous thrombosis which could manifest as intracranial venous sinus hyperdensity. Multiple small foci of subcortical T2* low signal on MRI head are typical of microhaemorrhages in amyloidosis. Larger joints tend to be affected rather than the hands, and features include subchondral cysts, erosions and osteoporosis without joint space narrowing. Soft tissue deposition of amyloid can lead to periarticular nodularity. Sarcoidosis causes symmetrical hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The musculoskeletal manifestations include a typical ‘lace-like’ appearance along with soft tissue swelling, cyst formation and resorption of the terminal tufts",

      "stem": "An adult male patient with abdominal pain undergoes a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis under the surgical team. The bowel loops are unremarkable and there is no free gas. However, there is a 5.5-cm bulky tumour centred on the right adrenal gland which has an irregular margin, foci of low attenuation and demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement. The tumour does not contain calcification or haemorrhage, and abuts but does not invade the inferior vena cava. There are multiple low attenuation, ill-defined lesions seen within the liver and several lucent foci within the lumbar spine, which are suspicious for metastases. The lungs have not been included on the scan. What is the most likely cause of the appearances of the right adrenal gland?",

        "Myelolipoma",
        "Phaeochromocytoma"
      ],
      "answer": "Metastasis from adenocarcinoma",
      "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is metastatic adenocarcinoma. Metastases to the adrenal gland can be large with a heterogeneous appearance, central necrosis, haemorrhage and irregular borders. The most common sites of primary malignancy are lung, breast, melanoma, gastrointestinal tract and renal. The main differential diagnosis is adrenocortical carcinoma. This has peak incidences in early childhood and in the fourth and fifth decade of life. This tumour is usually large at diagnosis and typically has central necrosis or haemorrhage. There is calcification in 30% and it can invade the inferior vena cava or the renal vein. However, adrenocortical carcinoma is relatively rare compared to metastatic adenocarcinoma. A collision tumour is a rare occurrence of two different pathologies in the same place and can be benign or malignant. There are no specific features described to indicate that lesion could be a myelolipoma, such as fat density or punctate calcification. A phaechromocytoma would usually demonstrate homogeneous enhancement. They are prone to haemorrhage and then can appear heterogeneous. Most are benign but some may be malignant and demonstrate metastases; however, this occurs less commonly than adenocarcinoma metastases",

      "stem": "A usually fit and well 73 year old man is investigated for weight loss and anaemia. There is a history of left nephrectomy for organ donation 5 years previously. Contrast enhanced CT chest, abdomen, pelvis is performed as part of this workup and demonstrates multiple endophytic, homogenous right renal lesions. The renal lesions appear mildly hypodense to the surrounding parenchyma. There are several enlarged, rounded retroperitoneal and pelvic lymph nodes. The renal vessels opacify normally. There are homogenous appearances of the other solid upper abdominal viscera. The chest is clear. The spleen measures 15.2 cm in craniocaudal extent. Renal MRI is performed to help characterise further and the renal lesions exhibit intermediate T1 and intermediate T2 signal. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

        "Primary lymphoma of the kidney",
        "Renal cell carcinoma",
        "Secondary lymphoma of the kidney"
      ],
      "answer": "Secondary lymphoma of the kidney",
      "explanation": "The imaging characteristics of the lesions, along with abdominopelvic lymphadenopathy and mild splenomegaly, make lymphoma most likely. Lymphoma of the kidney can be split into primary and secondary forms. The primary form is uncommon because the kidneys do not contain lymphoid tissue. The secondary form occurs because of haematogenous spread and is most likely to be non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Unlike renal cell carcinoma (RCC), typically lymphoma does not significantly affect the renal contour. Lymphomas often look slightly denser compared to adjacent normal renal tissue prior to contrast and are comparatively hypodense to the rest of the kidney following contrast. The MRI appearances are usually intermediate T1 and intermediate to low T2 signal. Lymphoma is typically more homogenous in appearance compared to RCC. Vascular invasion is an important feature when evaluating renal masses; RCC and leiomyosarcoma are more likely to invade the vessels, whereas lymphoma can encase them. Metastases do not typically invade the vessels either and are usually small lesions and cortically based. The most common primaries which metastasise to the kidneys are melanoma, lung, colorectal and breast. No other primary site is identified on the CT, although a melanoma primary is unlikely to be radiologically visible. The patient is male, making breast malignancy unlikely. CT cannot exclude gastrointestinal malignancy, and endoscopy could be considered, although if there was disseminated colorectal cancer, liver and lung metastases would also be expected. Leiomyosarcomas spread haematogenously; therefore lymphadenopathy is uncommon and the lesions are often positioned close to the renal pelvis and vessels",

      "answer": "Early peripheral enhancement with delayed central enhancement",
      "explanation": "Infantile hepatic haemangioendothelioma are vascular lesions causing arteriovenous shunting which can lead to high-output cardiac failure. These lesions are also associated with thrombocytopaenia due to consumptive coagulopathy. They are heterogenous vascular masses which can contain calcification. The aorta above the level of the coeliac trunk may be enlarged compared to the aorta below this level. Enhancement of these lesions is similar to a hepatic haemangioma with peripheral early enhancement and central filling in on delayed phases",

      "explanation": "The description of multiple cutaneous nodules and the finding of bilateral internal cerebral artery (ICA) occlusion is suggestive of Moyamoya syndrome in the setting of neurofibromatosis (NF) 1. Two conditions containing the name Moyamoya exist − a disease and a syndrome. Moyamoya disease translates as ‘puff of smoke’ from Japanese and is a vasculo-occlusive angiopathy. The puff-of-smoke description arises from the appearance of the intracranial collateralisation that occurs secondary to congenital stenosis and occlusion of the distal ICAs; however, it can affect other vessels within the circle of Willis too. On imaging there are commonly watershed infarcts and it may present with intraventricular haemorrhage. Moyamoya syndrome gives the same appearance on angiography but is not the result of a congenital ICA occlusion. It is associated with NF1, sickle cell, radiation, chronic infection, tuberculosis and atherosclerosis",

She has an uneventful recovery from theatre; however her mobile chest radiograph on ITU performed at 24 hours demonstrates bilateral perihilar airspace opacification. This finding continues to worsen over the next 48–72 hours. Echocardiogram excludes left ventricular failure and there is low clinical suspicion of infection. She receives supportive care and after 5 days the opacities improve. They have resolved by day 10. What is the most likely aetiology?",
      "options": [
        "Acute transplant rejection",

        "Infection",
        "Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease",
        "Reperfusion syndrome"
      ],
      "answer": "Reperfusion syndrome",
      "explanation": "The imaging features described are typical for reperfusion syndrome. This occurs in 95% of transplant patients within 48 hours of the procedure. It is non-cardiogenic oedema and is seen radiographically as bilateral perihilar airspace opacification and can occur alongside bibasal effusions. It resolves by day 10; persistence after this time is suggestive of infection or acute rejection. Acute transplant rejection usually occurs 10 days after transplant. Chest radiographs are normal in 50% of patients but there may be heterogeneous perihilar opacification, septal thickening and a pleural effusion. Diagnosis can be made by transbronchial biopsy. The imaging appearances of bronchiolitis obliterans are of bronchiectasis and air trapping, and this condition usually occurs 6–18 months after transplant. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease represents a proliferative disorder occurring from 1 month onwards. It manifests as lung nodules and adenopathy. The clinical scenario and imaging findings in this case are not in keeping with this. Infection can occur at any time and is the most common complication after transplantation; however reperfusion syndrome is the most common immediate complication and the imaging features described in the stem are in keeping with this condition",

A bell-shaped thorax and scoliosis can also be seen on plain films in this condition. Monosomy X is Turner syndrome. Chest radiograph may demonstrate thinning of the lateral aspect of the clavicles as well thinned and narrow ribs with pseudo notching.

      "answer": "Ectopic pancreatic tissue",
      "explanation": "The finding of a smooth nodular protrusion into the duodenum with a central depressed duct remnant is diagnostic for ectopic pancreatic tissue. Benign lymphoid hyperplasia typically demonstrates multiple filling defects and can be a normal variant in children but is indicative of hypogammaglobulinaemia in adults. Duodenal ulcers are most commonly more proximally in the bulbar part of the duodenum and are also more commonly anteriorly rather than posteriorly positioned. An adenocarcinoma of the papilla of Vater would be positioned laterally, expected to have ill-defined edges and may lead to obstruction.

The cerebellum is usually not affected. Pachygyria (broad gyri) and agyria (no gyri) also exist as subtypes within this spectrum of disorders. Schizencephaly is a cleft lined by grey matter extending between the pia mater and ependymal surface and often connecting the surface of the brain to the lateral ventricles. The open-lipped subtype has cerebrospinal fluid in the cleft and the closed lip subtype does not. Porencephaly occurs secondary to an in-utero insult, usually before the second trimester. It leaves a fluid-filled space communicating with the ventricles lined by white matter. Holoprosencephaly is incomplete septation of the two cerebral hemispheres. Hemimegalencephaly is when part of the brain is enlarged due to hamartomatous overgrowth; this can be an entire hemisphere or more limited",

They can occur following surgery or as a sequelae of chemo- or radiotherapy and also sometimes with infections, such as tuberculosis. CT can often be used to diagnose this condition; however, in this case when further clarification is required, a Xenon ventilation study can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating tracer activity in the pleural space. A CT pulmonary angiogram and a ventilation perfusion (VQ) study would not add anything further to the existing CT chest for this indication and would be more appropriate if pulmonary embolus was suspected. Inserting a larger bore chest drain is unlikely to clinically improve the situation and would not aid diagnosis. Larger bore chest drains can be indicated in the context of pleural effusions with thick fluid, for example empyema or haemothorax. Removing the chest drain when there is suspicion of a bronchopleural fistula could potentially lead to tension pneumothorax and therefore this is not an appropriate management plan",

      "explanation": "Fibrolamellar HCC is an uncommon variant of HCC affecting young patients with no risk factors. The tumour is typically large at diagnosis. The central scar is usually hyperechoic on ultrasound and hypointense on MRI sequences, which helps to differentiate it from the T2 hyperintense central scar in focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). The central scar generally does not enhance in fibrolamellar HCC but does in FNH. The age of the patient in this case is highly suggestive of fibrolamellar HCC over standard HCC. Fibrolamellar HCC can calcify; however this is less likely in HCC. Furthermore, fibrolamellar HCC is commonly isointense on venous phase imaging, whereas HCC shows early washout. Hepatic adenoma can occur in a similar age group; however they do not contain a central scar. They frequently contain fat and haemorrhage. The former leads to a drop of signal on out-of-phase imaging. Haemangiomas can appear hyperechoic on ultrasound but their enhancement is quite characteristic with peripheral enhancement that progresses centrally with time. They do not contain a central scar",

The latter is associated with paediatric patients. The history does not fit with hypotension, acute pyelonephritis or acute tubular necrosis. Urine dip would typically be abnormal in pyelonephritis and acute tubular necrosis, either showing signs of nitrites, blood or protein. If these conditions were suspected clinically, then answers B and D may be appropriate. If systemic lupus erythematous is suspected then an antinuclear antibody test would be helpful; however, this tends to be associated with glomerulonephritis, which causes swollen kidneys. Renal vein thrombosis would cause a unilateral striated nephrogram and is also unlikely in a patient without risk factors; therefore an ultrasound Doppler is unlikely to provide any additional information. Medullary sponge kidney does not progress to renal failure, and for most patients the condition is asymptomatic. It is often picked up incidentally and further follow-up is not required",

The radiographic appearance in the case is called the ‘double bubble’ sign. The majority of cases have an obstructive level which is just distal to the ampulla of Vater and hence the vomiting is bilious. Non-bilious vomiting would suggest a more proximal obstruction.

The difference between Modic type I changes and discitis is the disc signal. Normally discs are intermediate signal or, if there is disc dehydration, they may demonstrate low T2 signal, whereas in discitis they would be high on T2 and low signal on T1 sequences, due to inflammation. Answer A would be consistent with discitis. Modic type I is associated with pain and due to bone marrow oedema, and inflammation there is increased fluid in the region, hence T1 endplate signal is low and T2 endplate signal is high. Answer C would be consistent with Modic type I change. Modic type II changes are due to red marrow replacement, which is fatty; hence T1 endplate signal is high, as is T2 signal.

The torcular herophili (the confluence of the intracranial venous sinuses) is abnormally elevated. The variant condition is when not all of the findings are present and often the posterior fossa is not enlarged. If there is a posterior fossa cerebrospinal fluid cyst and the cerebellar vermis are normal in appearance, then the differential lies between arachnoid cyst and mega cisterna magna. The latter is a normal variant. An arachnoid cyst is suspected if there is adjacent mass effect. Chiari malformations do not cause an enlarged posterior fossa.

However, gadolinium-based contrast agent is avoided in pregnancy unless essential for diagnosis and management. An unenhanced MRI may still be helpful and is worth pursuing in the first instance. MRI should be avoided in the first trimester, and then in the second and third trimesters it is worth considering whether acoustic noise and specific absorption rate (SAR) can be reduced by amending the protocol. A contrast-enhanced CT would not be suitable in a pregnant patient for this indication due to the risks of ionising radiation.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (previously known as Churg-Strauss) can have ground glass opacification and consolidation but you may also expect centrilobular nodularity and serum eosinophilia. Sarcoidosis is also associated with nodularity, and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy is also common. Pleural effusions are not typical. Bronchopneumonia can cause bilateral scattered consolidation with Staphylococcus aureus infection potentially leading to cavitating pneumonia and empyema; however, in a young patient the full blood count would usually be abnormal.

The presence of dense metaphyseal bands may be physiological in children aged less than 3 years old. Dense metaphyseal bands can be seen in scurvy, which is relatively uncommon. It is caused by dietary lack of vitamin C. Other imaging features include generalised osteopenia, cortical thinning, periosteal reaction, Wimberger ring sign, Frankel line and Trümmerfeld zone.

Sometimes, similar to this case, they can present with haemorrhage. The most common site is the stomach, followed by the small intestine. They are usually benign but larger tumours, greater than 5 cm, are more likely to have malignant potential. Ninety percent of GISTs express c-KIT (CD117) antigen, a tyrosine kinase growth factor receptor. GISTs can be associated with several syndromes, including neurofibromatosis type I. The intracranial appearances are consistent with this – sphenoid wing dysplasia and focal areas of signal intensity (FASIs). Carney triad is also associated with GISTs.

Classical imaging characteristics for an oncocytoma include an isoechoic renal mass with a hypoechoic centre on ultrasound. CT of larger lesions such as this one can demonstrate a heterogenous mass and there can be perinephric fat stranding. Both CT and MRI demonstrate the typical non-enhancing central scar. Other MRI features include T1 hypointensity and T2 hyperintensity compared to the renal cortex. In this case an MRI is unlikely to add more information. Oncocytomas are benign but they are difficult to differentiate from renal cell carcinoma on imaging alone, and even a biopsy of a carcinoma can contain oncocytic components. Renal sarcomas are aggressive lesions. Often at this size there may be vascular invasion, and early haematogenous metastases are common. The CT scan on this patient does not demonstrate evidence of metastatic infiltration. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is surgical resection to help confirm what the lesion is and plan for the most appropriate management.

Signal characteristics of yellow marrow follow subcutaneous fat on all sequences, demonstrating high signal on T1 and T2 sequences. Red marrow is mildly hyperintense on T2 sequences but although on T1 imaging will be hyperintense to disc and muscle, it can be comparatively lower than the T2 signal and can be difficult to differentiate from metastatic marrow infiltration. In- and out-of-phase imaging can be helpful as the fat in yellow marrow will cause a drop in signal on the out-of-phase sequence which will not occur in metastatic infiltration. Haemosiderosis may be possible in this case due to episodes of haemolysis or potentially repeated transfusion but it would be expected to cause reduced T1 and T2 signal. Myelofibrosis is unlikely in this case but causes low signal on T1 and T2 sequences",

      "explanation": "An astrocytoma is the most common posterior fossa mass, but the radiological features of this mass favour medulloblastoma, which is the second most common. Medulloblastomas are solid masses which can grow quickly causing a relatively rapid onset of symptoms. They typically have low T1 signal and are T2 iso/hyperintense to grey matter. They are commonly more homogenous than other posterior fossa masses and demonstrate both enhancement and restricted diffusion. They arise from the roof of the fourth ventricle. It is important to image the rest of the neuroaxis to exclude drop metastases. Astrocytomas typically have a large cystic component with an enhancing mural nodule. The fourth ventricle is often displaced anteriorly. Ependymomas are frequently also in the fourth ventricle; however, they arise from the floor of the fourth ventricle and can extend out of the foramen of Magendie and Luschka. They are more heterogenous and commonly calcify. Brainstem glioma tend to occur in the pons causing diffuse enlargement, although they can sometimes cause an exophytic masses. Like medulloblastoma, they can return low T1 and high T2 signal; however, their enhancement and restricted diffusion is minimal in comparison. Paediatric choroid plexus papilloma are more common in the lateral ventricles and are usually well-defined cauliflower-like masses rather than the ill-defined mass described in this child",

There are various associations with tethered cord including spinal lipoma, diastematomyelia, thickened filum terminale, Chiari malformation, myelomeningocele and dermal sinus. In this case, the cord is tethered due to a lipoma; it follows fat on all sequences and does not enhance. Ependymoma and paraganglioma are other causes of filum terminale masses. Ependymomas are the most common but they are often more heterogenous than the mass described in this question with haemorrhage, cystic change and calcification. Paragangliomas are also usually more heterogenous and they also intensely enhance. Lipomyelomeningocele is a form of spina bifida. Although they do contain fat, it extends within the subcutaneous tissues and there are other important features such as neural arch defects. The bones in this case are normal.

The calcification is typical of a leiomyoma − they are the only oesophageal masses that calcify. If these are asymptomatic, then they do not need treatment; however, this patient does have symptoms and therefore surgical referral would be indicated. Breast carcinoma is the most common metastatic lesion to affect the oesophagus and often causes multiple submucosal nodules.

However, they can cause intraorbital masses presenting with proptosis. They usually increase in size over the first few months of life and then slowly regress. On imaging they appear as lobulated, septated masses which can span both the intra and extraconal compartments. They have curvilinear flow voids and enhance intensely. Cavernous haemangioma are more common in the adult population and are usually intraconal. They are rounded and well defined with the appearance of a capsule. Their enhancement tends to be slower and more patchy than a capillary haemangioma. Lymphangioma are usually extraconal and are more heterogenous with solid and cystic components and fluid-fluid levels. They can cause sudden proptosis due to haemorrhage. Due to their proteinaceous cystic components they are commonly high on T1 and T2 with minimal enhancement. Retinoblastomas are related to the globe and are heterogenous solid masses containing necrosis and calcification. On imaging, a venous varix appears as a dilated intraconal vessel and can be congenital or acquired, following trauma for example.

      ],
      "answer": "Fat embolism",
      "explanation": "Fat embolism can be encountered following trauma or other significant insults such as pancreatitis, burns, liposuction and severe sepsis. In the setting of trauma, long bone fractures are often the underlying cause due to fat from bone marrow entering the circulation. Initial imaging is normal, followed by delayed development at around 24–48 hours of consolidation, and ground glass opacity within the lungs, with fat density pulmonary artery filling defects also possible. In contrast to this, lung contusions and pulmonary lacerations would usually be present at the time of the initial trauma imaging. Lung contusions are often seen in the form of consolidation which is frequently peripherally sited at an interface between the lung and a firmer structure, for example the ribs or mediastinum. Pulmonary lacerations cause a defect in the lung which can fill with blood or air, in which case it is called a pneumatocele. Aspiration pneumonia is possible following trauma but the patient was intubated on admission to hospital so if it was not visible on the trauma CT it is unlikely to have developed since then in the presence of an inflated endotracheal tube. The short time interval between admission and the pulmonary abnormalities developing makes bronchopneumonia less likely",

      "explanation": "The description in the question is that of Perthes disease, also known as Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease. This is avascular necrosis of the capital femoral epiphysis, more common in boys between 4 and 8 years. Early changes include subchondral lucency, widened medial joint space and a small epiphysis with sclerosis. Later in the disease there may be fragmentation of the femoral head. Slipped upper femoral epiphysis typically affects adolescents aged 10–16 years. It is best seen on the frog-leg lateral views; the epiphysis is slipped posteriorly and the epiphyseal height reduced. Whilst osteomyelitis is an important consideration and appearances may include a joint effusion, osteopenia, periosteal reaction and focal bone lysis or cortical destruction, the features described in this case are typical for Perthes. Transient synovitis is the most common cause of hip pain in children. A joint effusion is common but would not account for the changes seen in the epiphysis. Haemophilic arthropathy is associated with a joint effusion, periarticular osteoporosis and epiphyseal enlargement",

      "answer": "Microcytic anaemia",
      "explanation": "Plummer-Vinson syndrome is characterised by an oesophageal web, iron deficiency anaemia and dysphagia. The web is often anteriorly located in the upper third of the oesophagus, but it can be circumferential. Other causes of oesophageal webs include graft-versus-host disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease and pemphigoid. A low CD4 count is associated with an impaired immune system, most commonly secondary to HIV infection. On a barium swallow this may manifest with signs of herpes simplex infection causing small superficial ulcers, candidiasis causing large plaque-like abnormalities with pseudomembrane formation, or cytomegalovirus oesophagitis causing giant ulcers. Raised gamma-glutamyl transferase suggests excess alcohol intake. This may be associated with variceal formation in chronic abuse which cause serpiginous luminal filling defects. Helicobacter pylori is associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and peptic and duodenal ulcers. Vitamin B12 deficiency can be secondary to gastric causes such as atrophic gastritis and following gastrectomy or due to ileal malabsorption, for example in Crohn’s disease",

The main risk for angiomyolipoma is retroperitoneal haemorrhage and lesions that are >40 mm should be considered for embolisation or surgical removal. Lesions that are <20 mm generally do not require follow-up due to slow growth, and angiomyolipoma between these measurements can be followed up with interval imaging. A patient may require MRI kidneys if there is any doubt about the lesions, for example if they are fat poor. Fat-saturated and in- and out-of-phase MRI sequences can be helpful. Patients with tuberous sclerosis are more likely to have renal cysts and can develop renal cell carcinoma at a younger age than the general population",

      "answer": "Croup",
      "explanation": "Croup or laryngotracheobronchitis is a viral upper respiratory tract infection usually affecting children up to the age of 3 years. It causes a characteristic barking cough and can cause inspiratory stridor. The findings on radiograph include subglottic narrowing, referred to as the ‘steeple’ sign, and hypopharyngeal distension. Epiglottitis is an important and potentially life-threatening differential to exclude. This causes epiglottic and aryepiglottic fold swelling which can cause the epiglottis to resemble a thumb. Epiglottitis is less common now due to infant Haemophilus influenzae type B vaccination; however, Streptococcus A can also cause it. These patients should not be laid flat for imaging as this could lead to complete airway obstruction. Exudative tracheitis is less likely in this age group as it usually affects older children. Radiographic findings would include membranous tracheal filling defects and irregularity. Retropharyngeal abscess is suspected if the retropharyngeal soft tissues are thickened; however, they are normal in this case. The subglottic narrowing and hypopharyngeal distension in this case is below the pharynx and therefore not consistent with pharyngitis",

      "answer": "Pial vessels peripheral to the mass",
      "explanation": "Differentiating intra- from extra-axial masses helps to narrow the imaging differential. Extra-axial masses can have various characteristics that may aid this task. An extra-axial mass will displace the subarachnoid and pial vessels medially towards the brain. If the pial vessels are peripheral to the mass it suggests it is a parenchymal, intra-axial mass. Extra-axial masses can cause adjacent skull changes such as hyperostosis with meningiomas; however, this is unlikely with an intra-axial lesion. Buckling of the grey−white matter interface is caused by the pressure exerted by an extra-axial mass on the adjacent brain. In contrast, an intra-axial mass will usually cause swelling and expansion of the white matter and cortex. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cleft sign is described as a thin rim of CSF or FLAIR hyperintensity between the mass and the brain parenchyma",

The ‘crazy paving’ description is typical for PAP but not pathognomonic. It refers to ground glass opacification in combination with smooth interlobular septal thickening.

Although desmoid tumours are most common in the abdomen, they can affect limbs but tend not be in direct contact with the tendon sheath. They can look similar on ultrasound if well defined, and also demonstrate low signal on T1 and T2 sequences; however, they would not demonstrate susceptibility artefact.

A mucinous cystadenoma is more common in middle-aged women and the cysts are less numerous and larger. Calcification is peripheral and the majority of masses are in the pancreatic body or tail. Main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) do occur in a more elderly age group and more commonly in the pancreatic head; however, they usually cause pancreatic duct dilatation (>3 mm). Calcification is not a typical feature. Islet cell tumours are neuroendocrine tumours, and when small are usually homogenous solid lesions rather than the cystic mass described in this question.

Tumour thrombus on MRI would also enhance and on T1 weighted imaging the normal vascular flow voids would be replaced by comparatively high tumour signal.\n18F-FDG PET/CT currently has a limited role in the staging of renal cell carcinoma due to renal excretion causing high renal tracer uptake and therefore making assessment difficult. However, there are reports of tracer uptake in tumour thrombi.\nUltrasound Doppler may identify thrombus; however the assessment of bland thrombus versus tumour thrombus would be challenging on ultrasound.\nDigital subtraction angiography does not have a role in this case",

The most commonly affected joints are hip, knee, elbow or ankle, and the most common pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus. The best way to obtain a diagnosis and target antibiotics appropriately is with joint aspiration followed by microscopy and culture of the synovial fluid. Radiology can offer assistance with ultrasound-guided aspiration if needed, but if clinical suspicion is high, joint washout may be pursued regardless.

The intracranial tumour described by the patient in the question likely represents a haemangioblastoma; however, choroid plexus papillomas are also possible. Patients can have cysts in the liver, pancreas and kidneys as well as renal angiomyolipoma, phaeochromocytomas and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumours. This group of patients is at increased risk of renal cell carcinoma, which can be bilateral and is typically of clear cell subtype. Tuberous sclerosis can cause angiomyolipomas. It carries an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma and is associated with intracranial tumours such as subependymal giant cell astrocytomas as well as other parenchymal brain abnormalities. However, the other features in the question are not typical. Pulmonary cysts, sclerotic bone lesions and cardiac rhabdomyomas are also encountered. Osler-Weber-Rendu is also known as hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia and is characterised by multiple arteriovenous malformations. Birt-Hogg-Dubé is associated with renal tumours such as renal cell carcinomas and oncocytomas as well as pulmonary cysts and cutaneous manifestations; however, the other lesions mentioned in the question are not consistent with this diagnosis.

The thyroid itself does not have to be abnormal, as patients can be euthyroid or post-treatment.

It is a condition causing cystic lung lesions arising from abnormal airway development. There are three subtypes; however the most common is as described with multiple large air-filled cysts. Immediately following birth these lesions may predominantly contain fluid and air-fluid levels. They can cause mass effect with atelectasis of adjacent lung and flattening of the diaphragm.\nThe mass described in the question is unlikely to be a bronchogenic cyst because there is no airway connection and therefore no gas in bronchogenic cysts unless complicated by infection, for example.\nThe supply of the lesion by the bronchial artery helps exclude pulmonary sequestration, which receives a systemic arterial supply. Similarly, this makes a diaphragmatic hernia, such as a Bochdalek hernia, unlikely.

      "explanation": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) can be split into pulmonary causes (e.g. toxic inhalation, drowning, lung contusion, pneumonia and fat embolus) and extrapulmonary causes (e.g. burns, sepsis, blood transfusion and pancreatitis). This case describes an extrapulmonary cause. The features of symmetrical consolidation with a gradient from posterior to anterior with more ground glass changes anteriorly is typical. Pulmonary causes tend to lead to asymmetrical changes without a gradient. A hospital-acquired pneumonia is possible, although the patient has only had a brief admission so far. An aspiration pneumonia is also possible, especially if there has been vomiting with recent alcohol excess, but in an intensive care patient with pancreatitis and such typical features of ARDS, this is less likely. In cardiac failure, other features such as cardiomegaly, prominent vascular markings, interstitial lines and pleural effusions would be more common. This patient does have a small left pleural effusion but this is likely secondary to the pancreatitis. One of the causes of fat embolism is pancreatitis, and features can resemble ARDS. Typical appearances of fat embolism include geographic ground glass opacities rather than the gradient seen in ARDS. Interlobular septal thickening and nodularity are also features, which are less common in ARDS",

There is relative reduction in the subchondral cortical thickness on the right and reduced bone density of the right proximal femur compared to the left.

      "answer": "Idiopathic transient osteoporosis of the hip",
      "explanation": "This tends to be unilateral, affecting males more than females, although it is described in late pregnancy. The history of hip pain is long, and the classic radiological description is of osteopenia and subchondral cortical loss. An MRI will demonstrate bone marrow oedema, centred on the subchondral region, and early post-contrast enhancement of the abnormal marrow. The history and presentation is not characteristic for septic arthritis and there is no indication that the patient is unwell, as this has been managed as an outpatient. In avascular necrosis the early post-contrast enhancement would not be typical. Although bone marrow oedema is a feature, other signs such as subchondral linear low signal and the ‘double line’ sign are usually present. A stress fracture in an active young patient is possible but in the proximal femur this tends to occur at the femoral neck rather than at the femoral head. A cortical breach and a linear low T1 signal fracture line would also be expected. Complex regional pain syndrome commonly occurs following trauma. Due to sympathetic dysfunction, other symptoms such as alteration to skin blood flow, hyperalgesia and oedema are often described. This condition typically affects the extremities rather than a large joint such as the hip. There is some overlap in radiographic features, with joint space preservation and osteopenia being typical",

      "answer": "Adenoma",
      "explanation": "The appearances are typical for a hepatic adenoma. These lesions can be large and heterogenous due to areas of necrosis and haemorrhage. Despite being benign, they are often removed due to the risk of bleeding. They may contain fat, leading to the hyperechoic appearance on ultrasound, T1 hyperintensity and signal drop on out-of-phase imaging. Adenomas can demonstrate washout, and are the only benign lesions which may do so. The hypointensity following hepatocyte specific contrast helps to differentiate it from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) which would be iso to hyperintense due to their hepatocellular origin. Similarly, the absence of a high T2 signal intensity central scar differentiates it from FNH. A fibrolamellar carcinoma typically has a low signal intensity central scar and many cases demonstrate calcification. Hepatic metastases are often T1 hypointense and there is not usually fat present. Haemangiomas commonly cause incidental hyperechoic hepatic lesions on ultrasound but the other features in this case are not typical. They characteristically exhibit centripetal enhancement",

      "explanation": "Choroid plexus papilloma are thought to increase cerebrospinal fluid production and impede absorption by the arachnoid granulations, so hydrocephalus is a common presentation. They typically occur at the trigone of the lateral ventricle. In children a supratentorial location is most likely; however in adults they are more common in the posterior fossa. The majority of tumours are benign but in up to 20% of cases they can become malignant. MRI signal is often described as T1 and T2 isointense with avid homogenous enhancement. Calcification occurs in around 10% of cases. These are distinct from the more common ependymomas, which are typically hypointense to grey matter on T1-weighted sequences and may have a characteristic ‘salt and pepper’ appearance on imaging due to calcification. Astrocytomas are also more common in children and frequently have a heterogeneous signal on MRI, which can range from solid enhancing lesions to cystic lesions with hemorrhagic areas. Medulloblastomas can also cause hydrocephalus in the young, and although they often enhance they have a more heterogeneous appearance on imaging and are much more likely to involve the cerebellum",

      "answer": "Alexander disease",
      "explanation": "Alexander disease is a progressive disease affecting the white matter in infants. It characteristically starts in the frontal lobes and progresses posteriorly, affecting the basal ganglia too. This causes white matter T2 hyperintensity and enhancement. In the late stages of the disease there can be cystic cavitation. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy has a more posterior distribution of T2 hyperintensity with changes affecting the periventricular parieto-occipital white matter and splenium of the corpus callosum progressing to affect the visual and auditory pathways, with peripheral enhancement commonly seen. Canavan disease has a symmetrical, diffuse, bilateral involvement of subcortical white matter. However, there is usually sparing of the caudate nucleus, corpus callosum and internal capsule. In contrast to Alexander disease, there is no contrast enhancement. MR spectroscopy will reveal elevated N-acetyl-aspartate, which is a hallmark of the condition. Krabbe disease affects the white matter with a periventricular predilection but in a more central and posterior distribution with involvement of the centrum semiovale, thalami and basal ganglia. There is no contrast enhancement in these regions and unlike other leukodystrophies there is enlargement of the optic nerves. Leigh syndrome is a mitochondrial disorder. The changes seen on imaging tend to be symmetrical with T2 hyperintensity in the brainstem, medulla, midbrain and putamen.

      "explanation": "Buscopan is used as an antispasmodic agent for studies where bowel motion may cause image degradation. A complication of Buscopan is acute angle closure glaucoma; however, the chronic open angle form of the condition is not a contraindication. Patients may not know they are at risk of acute angle closure glaucoma until they develop symptoms of eye pain, altered/reduced vision and nausea and vomiting, and so it is important that patients are warned about this. If a patient develops acute angle closure glaucoma, both eyes are usually treated by laser iridotomy at the first presentation to prevent recurrence. Unstable cardiac disease such as poorly controlled left ventricular failure, unstable angina, recent admission with acute coronary syndrome and recent arrhythmia are all contraindications for Buscopan. Hypothyroidism is not a contraindication. There should be caution exercised with hyperthyroidism due to its potential association with tachycardia. Buscopan can hypothetically lead to urinary retention; however, due to its short-acting effects and the relatively low dose used in radiology this is considered to be low risk. A history of prostate cancer should not be a contraindication for Buscopan usage. A conventional pacemaker device is a contraindication for MRI but not for Buscopan administration. Some newer pacemakers are marketed as MRI compatible within certain parameters. A pacemaker will have most likely been inserted due to dysrhythmia and therefore should be able to counteract any Buscopan-induced tachycardia; however, it may be prudent to discuss with cardiology first",

      "answer": "Phyllodes tumour",
      "explanation": "A phyllodes tumour is difficult to differentiate from other lesions, such as fibroadenoma, without a biopsy. Typical features include a predominantly solid lesion with posterior acoustic enhancement which may contain cystic spaces and vascularity. Rapid growth is also a characteristic. Breast carcinoma is commonly described as an ill-defined, hypoechoic and spiculate mass with posterior acoustic shadowing. The mass is typically vertically orientated, disrupting tissue planes. High-grade cancers can appear as more focal well-defined masses and hence why biopsy of solid breast lesions is so important. Lobular cancers may be difficult to identify on ultrasound. Fat necrosis follows trauma to the breast, and eliciting this history is important. Its appearance depends on the age of the lesion. It may initially be a focal hyperechoic area in the fat, then become more cystic manifesting as an oil cyst, and finally it can appear as a spiculate area due to desmoplastic reaction. Eggshell calcification is typically associated with it on mammograms. Fibrocystic change is common in young women and can be painful. Simple cysts on ultrasound are anechoic and well defined. A cyst with solid components requires biopsy of the solid component. Prominent fibrous glandular tissue may be palpated and visualised at ultrasound. Papillomas are a cause of nipple discharge and may appear as a solid lesion within a dilated duct or as a solid and cystic mass",

ADEM is a white matter abnormality favouring the subcortical white matter, but the brainstem and cerebellum can also be affected. The lesions are FLAIR hyperintense and can have peripheral restricted diffusion and enhancement. The history of recent illness or vaccination is key to the diagnosis. Herpes simplex encephalitis classically involves bilateral temporal lobes and cingulate gyrus. There is commonly both cortical and white matter and cortex T2 hyperintensity rather than the subcortical distribution in this case. There may also be microhaemorrhages. Cerebral abscesses are a differential for peripherally enhancing lesions; however they would usually have central restricted diffusion rather than just peripherally. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is not typical with this history because it is associated with an immunocompromised state.

This patient has no features to suggest that a partial nephrectomy would be contraindicated, and radiological-guided embolisation and radiofrequency ablation are less likely options in the setting of a renal mass of unknown malignant potential",

The radiological appearances of hyperinflation, focal emphysema and coarse lung markings are also typical. Sequestration and congenital lobar overinflation are conditions affecting part of the lung rather than all of the lungs and therefore the radiological findings and history are not consistent with these diagnoses. Viral pneumonia can cause hyperinflation and perihilar densities but the emphysematous changes in this child are not consistent with this diagnosis. As the name suggests, transient tachypnoea of the newborn exists for a short time, usually resolving by 2–3 days following delivery",

      "answer": "Anterior oesophageal indentation and posterior tracheal indentation",
      "explanation": "The question described typical findings in a pulmonary sling or aberrant left pulmonary artery. Neonates can present with respiratory distress due to narrowing of the trachea and narrowing of the right main bronchus or bronchus intermedius, which can lead to air trapping. The left pulmonary artery arises from the right pulmonary artery and passes between the trachea anteriorly and the oesophagus posteriorly, hence indenting the posterior wall of the trachea and the anterior wall of the oesophagus. It is the only vascular anomaly to pass between the trachea and oesophagus. A double aortic arch causes anterior tracheal and posterior oesophageal indentation. Anterior tracheal compression is caused by innominate artery indentation, which tends to occur in infants who have an arterial origin more towards the left than in adults. The mediastinum is more crowded in infants due to the thymus, and the vessel can therefore indent the trachea just inferior to level of the thoracic inlet. Posterior oesophageal indentation can either be caused with a normal left aortic arch with an aberrant right subclavian artery or with a right aortic arch if there is an aberrant left subclavian artery",

      "answer": "Progressive systemic sclerosis",
      "explanation": "Progressive systemic sclerosis, also known as scleroderma, causes dilatation of the distal two-thirds of the oesophagus due to fibrosis of the smooth muscle in this region. This leads to poor motility, dilatation and places patients at risk of aspiration. Other causes of oesophageal dysmotility include gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, presbyoesophagus, achalasia and Chagas disease. The patient also has thoracic features of scleroderma with peripheral lung reticulation and lymph node enlargement. Presbyoesophagus is considered to be age related and affects elderly patients frequently with comorbidities such as dementia and diabetes. Chagas disease is caused by a protozoal infection and also leads to cardiomyopathy and dilatation elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Achalasia frequently presents with dysphagia; over time the oesophagus becomes dilated, lacking normal motility with distal tapering rather than dilatation. Despite the mediastinal lymph node enlargement, the other radiological features described in this case are not typical for oesophageal carcinoma",

Radiologically they are usually part cystic and solid and exhibit T1 and T2 hyperintensity due to proteinaceous content. Calcification is very common. Germinomas are typically solid and are neither cystic nor calcified. In contrast to this, meningiomas do commonly calcify, but a cystic component is not usually a feature. Pituitary macroadenomas occur in an older age group and calcification is rare. Rathke cleft cysts are thin walled, cystic and generally show no enhancement",

      "explanation": "Along with colorectal cancer, there is a patient history of nephroureterectomy, consistent with previous urothelial malignancy. The family history reveals endometrial cancer and glioblastoma. These all fit with Lynch syndrome, otherwise known as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer. This is the most common cancer syndrome and increases the risk of urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma, endometrioid endometrial cancer and glioblastoma as well as ovarian, small bowel and gastric cancers. Apart from colorectal cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis is also associated with other conditions such as hepatoblastoma, osteomas, papillary thyroid cancer and desmoid tumours. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a condition which causes non-neoplastic hamartomas. These are not premalignant; however, the syndrome is associated with malignancies such as cervical adenoma malignum, breast, pancreas, ovarian and testicular tumours. Tuberous sclerosis predisposes patients to multiple gastrointestinal polyps but it is not associated with colorectal cancer. Associations with neurological tumours such as subependymal giant cell astrocytoma and renal angiomyolipoma, oncocytomas and renal cell carcinoma are documented. Turcot syndrome is characterised by colon cancer as well as primary brain tumours, such as glioblastoma and medulloblastoma.

This is a benign lesion, more common in patients in the second decade, typically lucent, expansile with multiple thin walled, blood filled cavities (fluid-fluid levels). ABCs are more common in the posterior elements with involvement of the vertebral body. Giant cell tumour (GCT) is an important differential diagnosis; however this usually affects patients in the third or fourth decades, and usually affects the vertebral body rather than the posterior elements. Fluid-fluid levels may be seen if there is secondary formation of an ABC within the GCT. A simple bone cyst may be multilocular and can have fluid-fluid levels representing haemorrhage. It usually affects the metaphysis/diaphysis of a long bone, pathological fractures are common and a fallen fragment is seen in 5%. Fibrous dysplasia has a variety of appearances. It is usually ground glass in appearance with a sclerotic margin, most commonly affecting the ribs, femur, tibia and craniofacial bones.
