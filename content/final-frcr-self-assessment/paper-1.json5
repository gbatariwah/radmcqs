This is isointense on T1 weighted sequences and mildly hyperintense on T2 weighted sequences.

      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Heel pad thickness of 30 mm",
      explanation: "The case describes a case of acromegaly. Typical features include frontal bossing and enlargement of the sinuses and mastoid air cells. Pituitary adenomas are frequently discovered and microadenomas are identified as small areas of reduced enhancement compared to the surrounding pituitary gland. Musculoskeletal findings include posterior vertebral body scalloping, spade-like terminal phalangeal tufts, calcified intervertebral discs and joint cartilage. Cartilage can also be subject to overgrowth causing joint space widening. Heel pad thickness above 25 mm is considered abnormal, and this can be assessed on lateral ankle radiographs. Decreased interpedicular distance is a feature of acromegaly and can lead to cord compression. In contrast to this, increased interpedicular distance is associated with dural ectasia which is described in conditions such as neurofibromatosis 1, ankylosing spondylitis, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and Marfan syndrome. Eleven paired ribs is linked with various conditions including several skeletal dysplasias and trisomy 18 and 21; however it is not associated with acromegaly. Madelung deformity is also not a feature of acromegaly but is described in Turner syndrome, Ollier disease, nail-patella syndrome, achondroplasia and Leri Weill syndrome. Sclerosis of the vertebral end plates, also known as ‘sandwich’ vertebrae in osteopetrosis and ‘rugger jersey spine’ in hyperparathyroidism, is not associated with acromegaly",

Barium swallow helps to obtain the diagnosis. There is smooth distal oesophageal tapering with proximal oesophageal dilatation and tertiary contractions. This is successfully treated at the time but 19 years later the same patient presents with dysphagia again. The barium swallow now demonstrates an irregular, shouldered narrowing with proximal oesophageal dilatation. Endoscopy confirms malignancy. Where is the new narrowing most likely to be sited?",

      response: "",
      answer: "Mid-oesophagus",
      explanation: "The patient was originally suffering with achalasia leading to dysphagia to both solids and liquids, which can be relieved with warm fluids. Barium swallow typically causes a characteristic ‘rat-tail’ narrowing of the distal oesophagus with associated oesophageal dilatation, an oesophageal air-fluid level and tertiary contractions. Warm water can be administered during the barium study to demonstrate relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter. Complications from achalasia include aspiration, pneumonia, oesophagitis and also malignancy. Approximately 5% of patients with achalasia develop oesophageal carcinoma and these strictures tend to occur in the mid-oesophagus. Most idiopathic oesophageal carcinomas are squamous cell carcinomas and these similarly arise in the mid-oesophagus. Oesophageal adenocarcinoma is less common but frequently related to Barrett oesophagus and arises distally at the gastro-oesophageal junction, therefore more commonly involving the proximal stomach",

      response: "",
      answer: "Acquired cystic kidney disease",
      explanation: "Acquired cystic kidney disease is associated with end stage renal failure and can affect patients having either peritoneal or haemodialysis. The condition becomes much more common the longer a patient has been on dialysis, with 90% of patients estimated to have developed it after a decade. The typical features include small kidneys and >3–5 cysts in each kidney. Unfortunately, there can be complications such as cyst haemorrhage – as has happened to this patient. There is also a risk of renal cell carcinoma; findings such as solid nodules and septations would warrant further assessment and this risk continues in the native kidneys following transplantation.\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is the most common hereditary cause of end stage renal failure; however the kidneys usually appear enlarged due to the innumerable cysts. The cysts can be variable in size and can become very large rather than the small cysts described in the question.\nAutosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease is a paediatric condition which tends to cause enlarged kidneys with a lot of small cysts and is also associated with hepatic fibrosis.\nTuberous sclerosis is associated with renal cysts as well as angiomyolipomas, which can also haemorrhage; however the most likely cause is acquired cystic kidney disease in the context of end stage renal failure",

The paediatric team are concerned about a possible seizure following the event and a couple of episodes of vomiting. The scan shows no intracranial haemorrhage.

The tentorium cerebelli and cerebellar vermis appear intact and have normal appearances. There is no hydrocephalus and the fourth ventricle is within normal limits. There is no significant enhancement following contrast administration. There is no restricted diffusion. On a FLAIR sequence the lesion is isointense to cerebrospinal fluid.

      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Mega cisterna magna",
      explanation: "Mega cisterna magna is usually an incidental diagnosis which causes the appearances of a cystic midline posterior fossa lesion located posteriorly and displacing the cerebellum. It follows cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on all MRI sequences. An arachnoid cyst would be another possible differential as it has the same signal characteristics, although the position is suggestive of mega cisterna magna. This appearance can be detected antenatally and in these cases can be associated with infections such as cytomegalovirus or chromosomal abnormalities.\nAn epidermoid cyst has similar appearances to an arachnoid cyst on imaging apart from on DWI and FLAIR sequences where there will be restricted diffusion and FLAIR hyperintensity compared to CSF.\nDermoid cysts are usually in the midline but they characteristically contain fat and will therefore have high T1 signal. If they rupture they may cause a chemical meningitis.\nEpendymal cysts also have similar imaging features to arachnoid cysts but are usually deep within the parenchyma or associated with the ventricles, being either peri or intraventricular.\nPilocytic astrocytoma is an important differential for midline paediatric posterior fossa lesions. They usually have a large cystic component with an enhancing solid nodule",

This reveals a solitary, oval, intradural extramedullary lesion extending from C5 to C6. It is sited anteriorly within the spinal canal and is isointense to the cord on T1, hyperintense on T2 sequences with heterogenous enhancement following contrast. It is displacing the spinal cord and right C5 nerve root and mildly widening the neural foramen. What is the most likely underlying cause?",

      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Schwannoma",
      explanation: "The intradural, extramedullary location raises the possibility of a variety of lesions. One mnemonic to aid memory is ‘MNM’: Meningioma, Nerve sheath tumours, Metastases. The lesion described in the case has typical imaging features of a schwannoma. They are most commonly found in the cervical and lumbar spine and cause neural displacement, bone remodelling and can have a dumbbell appearance.\nSpinal meningiomas are most commonly found in the thoracic spine. They have a characteristic dural tail and broad based dural attachment. They are usually T1 iso to hypointense, T2 iso to hyperintense and enhance homogenously following contrast. They are unusual in that they can calcify, but less commonly than intracranial meningiomas.\nMetastases in the spinal canal can arise from a primary within the brain or via haematogenous seeding from primaries such as breast, lung or melanoma. They can manifest as diffuse dural thickening and nodularity.\nSpinal paragangliomas are extramedullary and intradural however they usually involve the cauda equina region and so the location does not fit with this diagnosis. Their imaging characteristics are the same as for paragangliomas elsewhere in the body; they enhance avidly, can have flow voids and are T2 hyperintense. Additionally, they frequently show evidence of haemorrhage.\nEpidermoid cysts have a similar appearance to cerebrospinal fluid and would exhibit low T1 signal, high T2 signal and would not demonstrate the enhancement pattern described in this case. DWI and FLAIR imaging is important in the diagnosis of epidermoid cysts",

        "Investigation with a Gallium 68 PET scan",
      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Discharge the patient",
      explanation: "The presence of fat and description of ‘punctate calcification’ is typical for a hamartoma, which is a benign entity. Hamartomas are usually asymptomatic and most are detected incidentally. Typically they are peripheral; a minority (10%) are endobronchial. Malignant transformation is very rare. According to the most recent 2015 British Thoracic Society guidelines, nodules with clear benign features can be discharged without further imaging.\nHamartomas can demonstrate avidity on FDG PET in 20% of cases but this investigation is not warranted and likely to cause confusion rather than aid diagnosis.\nCT angiogram is not an appropriate next investigation; calcification is rare in arteriovenous malformations and there is no description provided of a feeding vessel. A Gallium 68 PET-CT scan can aid diagnosis of carcinoid tumour, however the description provided in the main stem is not suggestive of a carcinoid owing to the presence of fat. Although carcinoid tumours can be peripherally located (atypical 10%), more commonly they are central (typical 90%)",

      explanation: "Adhesive capsulitis is also known as frozen shoulder and classically presents with restriction in shoulder elevation and external rotation. It is most common in middle-aged women, particularly diabetic patients, and can also be associated with previous trauma. Classical radiological features are a thickened joint capsule and coracohumeral ligament. The subscapularis bursa is small, and lymphatic filling is a feature. The subcoracoid fat triangle between the coracohumeral ligament and coracoid process can be obliterated. The joint volume is reduced and therefore there is limited filling capacity during arthrogram injection",

There is associated atrophy of the peripheral segments, and regenerative nodules may be a feature.\nIn the acute presentation there is classically hepatosplenomegaly and ascites.

Chiari I malformation is associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome and is when the cerebellar tonsils descend ≥5 mm below the level of the foramen magnum. It is often asymptomatic and found incidentally in adults. As well as being associated with Klippel-Feil syndrome, it is also associated with craniosynostosis, hydrocephalus, syrinx and a tethered cord.\nHaemangioblastomas are a cause of predominantly posterior fossa cystic lesions and are associated with von Hippel-Lindau.

      answer: "Prostate carcinoma",
      explanation: "Vertebral metastases, when diffuse, can be difficult to appreciate. It is always important to compare the vertebral body signal to the adjacent disc. The signal of metastases depends on whether they are sclerotic or lytic. STIR signal is usually high and they demonstrate restricted diffusion. Lytic metastases would be low on T1 and high on T2 compared to the disc. However, sclerotic metastases would be low on both sequences.\nThe metastases in this case are consistent with sclerotic lesions and therefore the most likely primary site is prostate cancer. The other cancers are more commonly associated with lytic metastases. Melanoma is unusual in that it can demonstrate high T1 signal due to melanin",

      answer: "Primary osteochondromatosis",
      explanation: "The question describes multiple, intra-articular, cartilaginous nodules, with some early calcification. This is in keeping with osteochondromatosis and the relatively young age of the patient and lack of degenerative change is suggestive of the primary, rather than the secondary form of the condition. Radiographic appearances can be variable depending on the degree of ossification of the nodules but the typical calcification is described and ‘ring and arc’ which fits with a chondral pattern. Erosion on both sides of the joint can occur due to the synovial proliferation and mass effect.\nCalcification is rare in pigmented villonodular synovitis and when diffuse it can be more mass-like in appearance. Haemosiderin deposition within the synovial proliferation will demonstrate blooming artefact on gradient echo sequences.\nSynovial chondrosarcoma is rare but tends to have much more aggressive appearances extending beyond the joint with cortical erosion, marrow infiltration and potentially metastatic spread.\nSynovial haemangioma present as a soft tissue mass which will demonstrate linear areas of flow void on MRI and marked enhancement of the mass",

A bicuspid aortic valve is predisposed to stenosis and over time can cause aortic root dilatation due to the high pressure jet of blood through the stenotic valve. A congenital bicuspid aortic valve is one of the most common causes of aortic valve disease in young adults. Other conditions associated with aortic coarctation include ventricular septal defect, hypoplastic aortic arch, truncus arteriosus, scoliosis and Turner syndrome.

      answer: "Adjacent subchondral hypo- and hyperintense T2 linear signal",
      explanation: "The patient has features of sickle cell disease on abdominal radiograph with osteosclerosis, likely calcified gallstones in his right upper quadrant and a calcified spleen in the left upper quadrant. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is avascular necrosis of the hip. Radiographic features are often not visible, or subtle in the early stages, and osteopenia may be present. It is only later in the disease process that sclerosis, lucency, irregularity and flattening of the femoral heads develop. MRI is the most sensitive test for diagnosis and the most specific sign is the ‘double line’ sign which is paired high and low T2 linear signal. The low T1 signal parallels the subarticular cortex, also known as the ‘crescent’ sign − representing a subchrondral fracture. This would likely be associated with subchrondral high STIR signal in the acute phase. Low signal at the medial aspect of the femoral neck can be seen in stress fractures, which typically affect young patients; however the clinical findings are more in keeping with sickle cell anaemia and subsequent avascular necrosis. Synovial enhancement with gadolinium is not typical for avascular necrosis but would be seen in septic arthritis, which patients with sickle cell disease are at higher risk of; however you would also expect systemic illness",

      explanation: "The finding of gas locules adjacent to an aortic graft >3 months following surgery, a loop of small bowel in contact with the aorta, and thickening of the aortic wall are all concerning for a possible aorto-enteric fistula. These most commonly occur between the duodenum and aorta. This patient’s graft is suprarenal and therefore the position potentially places the patient at risk. Other radiological signs include pseudoaneurysm formation and disruption of the aortic wall. In acute cases there may be extravasation of contrast into the bowel lumen. Often patients present with a herald bleed which can then be followed by massive haemorrhage. This patient is anaemic, which, given the radiological findings, is concerning. Urgent action is required and the most appropriate step is to inform the vascular specialist registrar on-call; their team can review the patient and decide regarding further management. Another differential diagnosis would be graft infection, also a serious complication. Recent studies have suggested 18F-FDG PET/CT studies can help differentiate cases of infection from non-infected grafts; however, a more appropriate initial step would be to correlate with inflammatory markers and blood cultures",

If the patient is septic then antibiotics need to be given within an hour as per sepsis protocol; however, from the description there is no indication of sepsis and the patient is haemodynamically stable. Blood cultures should be obtained prior to antibiotics where possible. Urinary tract ultrasound is insensitive for pyelonephritis and the diagnosis should be clinical. Radiology can be helpful if there is concern regarding other diagnoses, such as urinary tract calculi; however, these are uncommon, particularly in young women. In an uncomplicated case of pyelonephritis no imaging may be required. Radiology can be incorporated if there is concern regarding abscess formation, infarction or obstruction. Ultrasound would be preferable over CT in the first instance to reduce radiation exposure in a relatively young patient",

Abnormally thickened gastric folds are described as above 3–5 mm at the prepyloric region and >5–10 mm at the fundus. The most common cause of thickened gastric folds is alcoholic gastritis. In contrast to this, atrophic gastritis causes inflammation and atrophy of the gastric glands causing loss of rugae and a smooth, featureless stomach. Another cause of thickened folds is lymphoma, which is the most common malignant cause. Other findings would include diffuse stomach wall thickening and ulceration causing wall irregularity. Crohn’s disease and Zollinger-Ellison syndrome can also cause thickened folds, along with multiple ulcers and a cobblestone appearance in the former.

Once greater than 4 cm in size, the risk of haemorrhage increases and embolisation or partial nephrectomy should be considered.

It can sometimes be difficult to exclude renal cell carcinoma (RCC), particularly those containing microscopic fat or if the angiomyolipoma is lipid poor. MRI may be helpful in these cases.

Although an urgent ultrasound is frequently requested, this may not reveal a significant abnormality, especially in cases of intermittent torsion. Therefore appropriate clinical assessment is vital. In this case, the left epididymis is swollen and heterogenous with increased vascularity, and this is consistent with epididymitis. Torsion of the appendix testis has similar symptoms to testicular torsion. Specific findings may not be evident on ultrasound and it is sometimes a diagnosis of exclusion; however occasionally the appendix may be visible as a small structure at the upper pole of the testicle with internal echoes which is hypoechoic compared to the adjacent testicle. A hydrocele and scrotal wall oedema may also be present. The small, thin-walled lesion at the epididymal head has features of a cyst with anechoic echotexture and posterior acoustic enhancement. In this position, this is likely to be an epididymal cyst. Findings that would be suggestive of orchitis would be hypoechoic echotexture and hypervascularity within the testicle itself.

      explanation: "Bone scans are sensitive but not specific for osteomyelitis. The bone scan will often be abnormal before any radiographic changes are evident. The three phases are angiographic, tissue and osseous phases. Osteomyelitis will demonstrate increased tracer uptake on all three phases due to increased blood flow to the region, increased tracer uptake within the adjacent inflamed soft tissues and then increased uptake within the bone itself. This is in contrast to cellulitis where uptake would only be increased on the angiographic and tissue phases. The most sensitive test for osteomyelitis is MRI which can reveal bone marrow oedema as the earliest change. After several days a low T1 signal area, representing intraosseous or subperiosteal abscess, may be evident with surrounding intermediate T1 signal which enhances (penumbra sign). Radiographic features are often delayed and include soft tissue swelling, periosteal reaction and soft tissue gas",

      explanation: "It is important to know the different imaging characteristics of benign and malignant gastric ulcers. Carmen meniscus is a sign caused by malignant ulcers; there are heaped-up margins causing an inner ulcer margin, which is convex towards the lumen and causes subsequent lenticular pooling of barium in the ulcer, whereas a benign ulcer has a smooth concave shape without heaped-up margins. The gastric folds therefore do not reach the edge of a malignant ulcer as they do in a benign ulcer. Hampton’s line, associated with benign ulcers, is a radiolucent line seen at the edge of the ulcer. A way to remember these two signs is Carmen = Carcinoma and Hampton = Harmless. Lesser curve ulcers are more typically associated with benign ulcers, whereas malignant ulcers tend to be found on the greater curve. Benign ulcers tend to be exoluminal, extending beyond the gastric contour, whereas malignant ulcers are endoluminal and do not",

      explanation: "Nephroblastomatosis is the presence of embryonic renal tissue beyond 36 weeks’ gestation. It is known to be a risk factor for nephroblastoma (Wilms tumour). The appearances are either of a lesion which can have plaque-like or nodular appearance, low on T1 and T2 weighted sequences with minimal enhancement compared to the adjacent renal parenchyma. In comparison, a Wilms tumour is usually T2 hyperintense and heterogenous in appearance with areas of necrosis and haemorrhage. Enhancement would be greater than nephroblastomatosis and inhomogeneous. Wilms tumours are also frequently large at diagnosis. Mesoblastic nephromas typically involve the renal sinus and are also usually more heterogenous in appearance; it is therefore difficult to confidently differentiate them from a Wilms tumour on conventional imaging. Multilocular cystic nephromas are multicystic renal lesions which classically herniate into the renal hilum. A prominent column of Bertin can be mistaken for a renal mass.

In the initial exudative phase there is airspace filling with fluid which is seen on radiographs as patchy, and peripheral airspace opacification which can develop into confluent dense consolidation. On CT, the consolidation is mostly in the dependent aspect of the lung (consolidation in the non-dependent aspect of the lung is in keeping with non-ARDS causes of consolidation). A fibrotic phase can then occur as early as 1 week later. On radiograph, reticular opacities may be seen, and on CT the fibrosis has an anterior distribution (due to the effects of barotrauma).

      explanation: "The patient has symptoms and sonographic signs of cholecystitis with gallbladder wall thickening (>3 mm) and pericholecystic fluid. Adenomyomatosis is associated with gallstones and causes both diffuse or focal thickening of the gallbladder wall. On ultrasound, bright echoes may be seen in the wall with ‘comet tail’ ring down artefact from Rokitanky-Aschoff sinuses. The main differential for wall thickening, particularly when focal, is gallbladder carcinoma. MRI can be helpful in differentiating the two diagnoses, with the finding of multiple curvilinear foci of T2 hyperintensities (string of beads sign) in the wall being highly specific and the hallmark for adenomyomatosis. Gangrenous cholecystitis can develop secondary to ischaemia and necrosis of the gallbladder wall and is more likely in diabetic patients; however these MRI appearances are typical for adenomyomatosis. Mural gas on T2 weighted imaging would appear hypointense rather than the hyperintensities described in this patient. Gallbladder polyps are frequently incidental findings and are polypoid ingrowths into the lumen rather than an area of thickening. The finding of a Phrygian cap is an incidental anatomic variant where there is folding at the fundus which can produce a thickened or septated appearance on ultrasound.

MRI features include right ventricular thinning and dilatation with wall motion abnormality and high T1 fat signal in the right free wall. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common cardiomyopathy causing dilatation of all cardiac chambers and widespread reduced contractility. It tends to be a diagnosis of exclusion. An established myocardial infarct could demonstrate low T1 and T2 signal in the wall due to scarring with associated wall thinning and motional abnormality; however, in this age group it is less likely. MRI findings of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy would include left ventricular hypertrophy with systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. It is another cause of arrhythmia and sudden death in young adults. Restrictive cardiomyopathy is caused by diastolic filling impairment and the ventricles are typically small due to causes such amyloidosis, sarcoidosis and haemochromatosis",

Inflammatory changes of the muscles can lead to soft tissue calcification which typically is sheet-like in appearance, although can manifest as non-specific subcutaneous calcification. On MRI the muscles can have high T2 and STIR signal, indicating oedema with low signal related to any calcification. With long-standing disease the muscles may undergo fatty infiltration. Dermatomyositis is associated with underlying malignancy, most commonly oesophageal, melanoma, genitourinary and lung.

Nutcracker syndrome is due to compression of the left renal vein as it passes between the SMA and aorta. Mesenteric ischaemia would be unlikely in a patient of this age.

The density of the fluid is not consistent with acute haemorrhage and would be more in keeping with urine, and therefore urinary bladder injury needs to be excluded. There is a urinary catheter in situ and therefore a CT cystogram can be performed to evaluate further. If the fluid was high density and there was a concern regarding acute haemorrhage clinically then triple phase CT could be considered; however, in this case there has already been contrast administered which will confuse the findings, as a true non-contrast scan could not be obtained. Confirmation and characterisation of any urinary bladder injury is important as it will impact further management. Extraperitoneal rupture, characterised by contrast extravasation into the extraperitoneal space, which can extend into the thighs, anterior abdominal wall and scrotum, is treated conservatively. However, intraperitoneal rupture, when contrast extravasates around bowel loops, would require surgical intervention. Subserosal bladder rupture is less common but suggested when there is elliptical contrast extravasation adjacent to the bladder. Sometimes a delayed phase CT can be helpful to obtain an excretory phase of contrast and helps exclude urine leak, for example from the ureters; however, the urinary bladder will be more uniformly opacified and better distended on a CT cystoscopy",

The classic appearance is flowing osteophytes affecting ≥4 contiguous vertebrae, commonly in the thoracic spine tending to occur on the right side of the vertebral bodies as aortic pulsation inhibits ossification on the left. In contrast to degenerative change of the spine, intervertebral disc spaces are preserved. If DISH affects the cervical spine it can cause dysphagia. There can be calcification of the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments but the facet joints are spared, as are the sacroiliac joints (unlike ankylosing spondylitis). Calcification can occur elsewhere, for example along tendons and ligaments such as the calcaneus, patella, iliac crest and around the elbow.

      answer: "111In-octreotide study",
      explanation: "The top differential for a distal small bowel tumour containing calcification with low density lymph node involvement is a carcinoid. These are most common in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the terminal ileum, followed by the rectum and colon. They can be plaquelike or polypoidal and tend to hyper enhance. Similarly, any liver metastases hyper enhance on an arterial phase study compared to the portal venous phase, when they may become difficult to appreciate. Up to 70% of the primary tumours contain calcification. Carcinoids can affect the mesentery causing the typical ‘spoke wheel’ appearance of desmoplastic reaction. The symptoms are often non-specific. The most appropriate answer is 111In-Octreotide study which aids diagnosis, detects occult tumours and helps to assess disease extent enabling appropriate treatment planning. An arterial phase CT chest and abdomen may aid diagnosis of distant metastases, including arterially enhancing liver lesions, but a 111In-Octreotide study is recommended at baseline for all patients with these tumours. 5-HIAA serum levels can be raised in functioning tumours but this serum marker will not aid treatment planning in terms of disease extent. 18F-FDG PET/CT is not routinely used in carcinoid tumours as uptake can be low, particularly in low grade lesions, due to relatively low metabolic rate.

This is an important distinction to make as recurrent prolapse would be treated surgically whereas surgeons would be reluctant to intervene for postoperative fibrosis. It can be difficult to distinguish between the two entities on non-contrast imaging as both have low T1 signal, although fibrosis tends to have irregular borders and evidence of thecal retraction towards the area of interest. In contrast to this, a disc would typically have a smoother border. Following gadolinium administration, scarring enhances early whereas a disc will either not enhance or enhance late. Enhancement of the fibrosis diminishes after a few years. DWI and ADC imaging are not routinely performed for spinal imaging. High T2 signal in a disc is associated with discitis",

The most common causative organism for discitis in the general population is Staphylococcus aureus, and blood cultures are positive in around 50–70% of cases. In patients with sickle cell disease, Salmonella should be considered. Candida is less common. Burkholderia pseudomallei is more commonly encountered in locations such as southeast Asia and Australasia. Spondylodiscitis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) (also known as Pott disease) would also be within the differential for this patient, although this is a relatively acute presentation and usually TB discitis tends to have a longer history without much systemic upset. It is not unusual for the chest radiograph to be normal in TB discitis. There can be reduction in vertebral body height causing a ‘gibbus’ deformity.

      answer: "Amyloid angiopathy",
      explanation: "This condition is due to beta-amyloid protein deposition in small vessel walls of the cortical, subcortical and leptomeningeal regions leading to spontaneous multifocal peripheral cortical and subcortical haemorrhage. Patient are typically elderly and normotensive. On MRI there are usually multiple cerebral microhaemorrhages evident on susceptibility weighted imaging at the grey−white matter junction and in the cerebellum. Acute haemorrhage can lead to lobar haemorrhage, subarachnoid blood and more chronically, superficial siderosis. Hypertensive haemorrhage tends to occur in the basal ganglia whereas amyloid angiopathy spares this region. First presentation of an arteriovenous malformation would be unusual in this age group and they are more commonly solitary. Haemorrhagic metastases would be within the differential particularly in more mature patients. The presence of acute haemorrhage along with features of more chronic microhaemorrhages is more indicative of amyloid angiopathy than metastatic disease. Herpes encephalitis can lead to cortical microhaemorrhage but the distribution is typically the bilateral temporal lobes and this diagnosis would not account for the frontal haemorrhage. Other signal changes such as cortical T2 hyperintensity and restricted diffusion would be likely",

Patients can present with non-specific symptoms. It is more common in women than men and tends to affect young adults. Typically imaging demonstrates arterial wall thickening and enhancement causing stenosis, associated aneurysmal dilatation and potentially occlusion. Takayasu often involves the pulmonary arteries causing peripheral pruning and can also affect the carotid arteries, hence a carotid Doppler ultrasound is the most appropriate investigation out of the available options.

The differentials for this include metabolically inactive bone lesions such as bone cysts and islands, osteoporosis, new fractures (<48 hours old), multiple myeloma or metastases with no osteoblastic activity.

Most bony breast cancer deposits do demonstrate tracer uptake on nuclear medicine bone scans; however some breast cancers and other osteolytic metastases, such as from renal, thyroid or lung cancer, can be non-avid. However, these cancers tend to create photopenic foci. Osteomyelitis can cause lytic lesions on radiographs but the multiplicity is not typical and therefore blood culture would not be appropriate.

      explanation: "The most specific radiological sign in coeliac disease is jejunoileal fold pattern reversal. So called due to jejunisation of the ileum, this means that there are an increased number of ileal folds to compensate for reduced jejunal folds. Fluoroscopic imaging in coeliac disease can also demonstrate changes secondary to increased fluid secretion, such as flocculation and dilatation; however, these are not as specific. There can also be an absence of valvulae conniventes, otherwise known as the ‘moulage sign’ and regions of small bowel intussusception. Crowding of the valvulae conniventes, reduced peristalsis and small bowel sacculation is more commonly associated with scleroderma. Crowding of the valvulae conniventes in scleroderma is often referred to as a ‘hidebound’ appearance – the bowel folds are not thickened. This is in contrast to a ‘stack of coin’ appearance where the folds are smoothly thickened and can be seen in conditions associated with haemorrhage into the bowel wall, such as coagulopathies, ischaemia and vasculitides.

      explanation: "There are two subtypes of femoroacetabular impingement (FAI); cam FAI is more common in young men versus pincer FAI which is associated more with middle-aged females. Cam FAI is caused by a non-spherical femoral head impacting against the acetabulum; typically there is a flattening at the junction between the femoral head and neck with an osseous bump just lateral to the physeal scar. This is associated with subsequent degenerative change and labral tears. Cartilage and labral injuries tend to be positioned anterior-superiorly. The alpha angle is frequently cited and an angle >55–60° (depending on the article) is considered abnormal. Pincer FAI is due to a deep acetabulum; therefore the coverage of the femoral head is increased and leads to abnormal contact between the femoral head/neck junction and the overhanging acetabulum. Chondral injury is more typically circumferential versus the anterior-superior position in cam FAI. It is also possible to have a combined type of FAI",

In this question the low attenuation liver lesions are longstanding and of unlikely clinical significance. In contrast, the multiple bilateral lung nodules are concerning. The presence of lung metastases in the absence of convincing liver lesions makes a rectal primary site most likely as the drainage of the rectum is via the pelvic veins directly into the inferior vena cava. Consequently, metastatic spread can bypass the portal venous system and the liver, causing lung metastases. The superior rectal vein drains into the portal venous system but the middle and inferior rectal veins drain directly into the inferior vena cava",

The lesion on the right kidney is consistent with a Bosniak 2F cyst with thin septae and nodular calcification; this will require CT follow-up. Once septae or walls become thickened and nodular with measurable enhancement then the cyst falls into the Bosniak 3 category and many patients will undergo invasive management, either surgery or radiofrequency ablation. The lesion associated with the left kidney is hyperdense. This CT is enhanced, likely portal venous phase imaging for this clinical indication, so we need to establish whether this hyperdensity is enhancement or due to the inherent density of the lesion. A hyperdense renal cyst should not significantly change density between the unenhanced and the enhanced sequences. A soft tissue mass would demonstrate a significant difference being lower density on the unenhanced and then increasing following contrast administration. The patient should be fully worked up prior to being discussed at the multidisciplinary team meeting and therefore although the patient will require follow-up for the right Bosniak 2F lesion, the unenhanced CT should be performed in the first instance to complete the imaging and complete characterisation of the lesion",

      answer: "MacLeod syndrome",
      explanation: "MacLeod syndrome, also known as Sywer-James syndrome, is thought to occur secondary to childhood infectious bronchiolitis. Previous infections with mycoplasma pneumoniae and viral infections are thought to play a role. It causes a unilateral, often small, lucent lung with reduced vascularity and expiratory air trapping. It can be an incidental finding in adulthood. The history in this case is not typical for congenital lobar over inflation (CLO), which was previously known as congenital lobar emphysema. CLO usually presents in neonates with respiratory distress. It most commonly affects the left upper lobe, followed by the right middle and upper lobes. It tends to cause marked mediastinal shift. Pulmonary agenesis causes an absent lung on one side with no vasculature. Therefore, this usually causes a dense hemithorax with mediastinal shift towards the affected side due to cross-herniation from the contralateral side. Poland syndrome is a congenital unilateral absence of the pectoralis muscles. It would not cause a small unilateral hemithorax and would also not impact the vasculature. Scimitar syndrome does not typically cause a lucent lung; however, the lung is commonly small, with associated ipsilateral mediastinal shift and anomalous venous drainage.

      answer: "Repeat ultrasound in 3 weeks",

This often presents as an asymptomatic abdominal mass, and depending on the age of the haemorrhage it can have variable sonographic appearances. Acutely they may appear more solid with internal echoes but over time blood products liquify and they become more heterogenous with cystic components. Chronically they may calcify. The main differential is neuroblastoma which can have similar appearances of a solid appearing mass. One distinguishing feature is the history, and in this case there is a history of a traumatic birth. Secondly, the lack of vascularity is indicative of adrenal haemorrhage rather than neuroblastoma. On follow-up ultrasound, adrenal haemorrhage will decrease in size over time, whereas neuroblastoma will increase in size. Therefore prompt follow-up ultrasound is important. Ultrasound guided biopsy would not be indicated and MRI is usually reserved for challenging cases. MIBG is often used in the staging of neuroblastoma",

      answer: "Non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)",
      explanation: "Rheumatoid arthritis can be associated with both usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern of disease as well as NSIP. The features described on the CT are more typical for NSIP. Radiological overlap between the two diseases can occur; however the UIP pattern is associated with honeycomb destruction of the parenchyma compared to the predominantly ground glass opacification seen in NSIP. The immediate subpleural sparing is considered specific for NSIP and traction dilatation occurs due to the fibrotic process pulling the small airways open. Although UIP is associated with an apicobasal gradient, the parenchymal changes are typically peripheral rather than diffuse, as can be the case in NSIP. Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis can manifest as ground glass subpleural nodularity with subpleural sparing, representing infiltrate into the small airways. There may also be mosaicism secondary to air trapping. In the chronic stage, features of lung fibrosis can occur, although this is more typically in the upper zones. The predominant imaging finding in cryptogenic organising pneumonia is ground glass change and dense consolidation. Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia is very rare and more typically associated with Sjogren syndrome or HIV. The main imaging finding is ground glass opacification and perivascular cysts",

The whole uterus can be affected, appearing bulky and thickened, or it can be more focal, as in this case.

Patients between 30 and 50 years present with recurrent transient ischaemic attacks and stroke. On MRI there are often multiple areas of subcortical white matter T2 hyperintensity with similar appearances to small vessel disease. However, patients with CADASIL are younger and lack vascular risk factors. Anterior temporal lobe and external capsule involvement is common. Occipital lobe involvement is unusual. CADASIL is eventually associated with cerebral atrophy and dementia. The history does not fit with Susac syndrome; this condition affects women, causing a triad of encephalopathy, retinal artery occlusions and sensorineural hearing loss. MELAS (mitochondrial encephalomalacia with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) presentation can be similar to CADASIL with recurrent stroke; however there are other symptoms and signs such as lactic acidosis, encephalopathy and seizures. The distribution differs too, with parietal and occipital lobe involvement more common. Although acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) can cause subcortical T2 white matter hyperintensity, it usually presents differently with fever, seizure, reduced GCS and headache. Amyloid angiopathy affects an older age group and acute presentations with stroke-like symptoms is due to haemorrhage rather than ischaemic infarcts.

Nocardia is another possible causative agent.

      explanation: "Haemangiopericytomas are rare, aggressive tumours of the meninges. They are often solitary. Their appearances can be very similar to meningioma with T1 and T2 isointensity and a dural tail but should be suspected if there are atypical features such as bone erosion or if a lesion lacks common characteristics of a meningioma such as calcification or adjacent hyperostosis. Meningiomas are usually homogenous in appearance. In contrast to this, the vascular nature of haemangiopericytomas means that there are often visible flow voids. Meningiomas are associated with increased alanine levels on MRI spectroscopy but this is absent in a haemangiopericytoma",

      explanation: "Actinomycosis is a bacterial infection which is relatively uncommon, usually affecting those who have chronic debilitating illnesses, poor oral hygiene (the organism is usually spread to the thorax following aspiration from the oropharynx) or alcoholism. Most cases of actinomycosis are seen in the cervicofacial region (50–65%). The thorax is the second most common site, accounting for 15–30%. In the thorax it usually presents as chronic consolidation with low attenuation foci centrally, representing abscess formation. Actinomycosis is able to spread beyond connective tissue planes, hence the described chest wall invasion and periostitis of the adjacent ribs. Patients with previous history of lung destruction secondary to previous infection, such as tuberculosis, are more susceptible to the infection. Furthermore, the presence of sulphur granules within the specimen is also highly suggestive for diagnosis of the infection (although this may also be seen in infection with other fungal-like organisms)",

      explanation: "The patient has an underlying diagnosis of gout which is associated with hyperuricaemia. Although 24-hour urine collection can demonstrate high urine uric acid levels, the gold standard test is joint aspiration to confirm the presence of monosodium urate crystals. The MRI findings are consistent with gouty tophi which are usually low on T1 sequences, heterogeneously low on T2 weighted imaging and enhance following gadolinium administration. Tophi can erode into adjacent bone causing marrow oedema, and there can be oedema adjacent to the typical punched out marginal erosions. Gout has a predilection for certain tendons around the knee including the patellar and popliteus tendons. Serum parathyroid hormone levels would confirm hyperparathyroidism which can cause calcific soft tissue lesions particularly in secondary hyperparathyroidism. 18F-FDG PET/CT could help to confirm FDG avidity in potentially malignant conditions such as a synovial sarcoma however appearances and history are not typical for this.

This patient is young and although asymptomatic it would be important to ascertain if there is evidence of disease recurrence so prompt management can be administered if appropriate. A CT cologram is used for asymptomatic screening and following a failed colonoscopy but its use is not appropriate in this setting. Furthermore, rectal cancer is better visualised and locally staged using MRI rather than CT. An MRI pelvis could be helpful in the identification of recurrence more than 6 months following surgery, with the latter demonstrating higher T2 signal intensity compared to post-surgical fibrosis. FDG-PET/CT is also helpful in recurrence as there will be increased tracer uptake compared to post-surgical changes. An MRI liver may be helpful in assessing for metastatic spread; however with T3N1bM0 disease it is important to exclude local recurrence, and an FDG-PET/CT should also identify any distant disease, for example in the liver",

Grade V injuries include a shattered kidney, main renal artery laceration, thrombosis and complete avulsion of the renal pelvis which devascularises the kidney. Grade I includes contusion and haematoma. Grade II extends to include a parenchymal laceration up to 1 cm without a urine leak or a non-expanding perirenal haematoma confined to Gerota fascia. Grade III is a laceration >1 cm, again without a urine leak or a vascular injury contained within Gerota fascia.

      explanation: "The vomiting, abdominal pain, retrocardiac air-fluid level, inability to pass a nasogastric tube and raised lactate is consistent with gastric volvulus. The elevated lactate is concerning for ischaemia. Organo-axial gastric volvulus is more common in adults and often associated with a diaphragmatic defect, sometimes following trauma or with a para-oesophageal (rolling) hiatus hernia. The previous chest radiograph demonstrating an air-fluid level is suggestive of this. This type of volvulus can be chronic and asymptomatic; however, the appearance of the air-fluid level increasing and its position, along with the other clinical symptoms and signs, suggests that the stomach has volved and become trapped above the diaphragm. Mesentero-axial gastric volvulus is more common in children and also more frequently associated with vascular compromise due to twisting of the mesentery. Epiphrenic diverticulum can occur secondary to conditions with oesophageal dysmotility and raised oesophageal pressure, such as achalasia. The presentation in this case is not typical as they often present with dysphagia and regurgitation.

Papillary tumours are often hypovascular and poorly enhancing, hence the minimal change in density following contrast administration during the CT. The MRI findings of homogenous hypointensity on T1 and T2 weighted images are also consistent with this diagnosis. Clear cell carcinomas are usually T2 hyperintense; they enhance more and can be more heterogenous in appearance. Similarly, oncocytomas are usually heterogenous and can also demonstrate a central scar and pseudocapsule. Renal lymphoma frequently causes multiple masses and diffuse renal infiltration rather than a discrete mass. Like papillary carcinoma it can be poorly enhancing; however it is usually T1 hypointense and T2 iso- or hyperintense. A haemorrhagic renal cyst would typically be T1 hyperintense and T2 hypointense.

      explanation: "The imaging appearances are characteristic of a medulloblastoma with a posterior fossa mass which is hyperdense on CT and demonstrates restricted diffusion on MRI. The demographics are also typical (age <5 and male). Fifty percent of patients with medulloblastoma will have leptomeningeal metastases at presentation. Therefore, whole spine imaging is recommended as part of the workup",

There is a mass at the inferior aspect of the orbit involving the left inferior rectus, inferior oblique and lateral rectus muscles, including the tendons.

      response: "",
      answer: "Pseudotumour",
      explanation: "Pseudotumours most commonly involve the lacrimal glands but can involve the extraocular muscles, commonly the lateral rectus muscle. They involve the whole muscle including the tendon, whereas thyroid ophthalmopathy spares the tendon. Pseudotumours are iso- to hypointense on T1 imaging and hypointense on T2 imaging whereas true tumours, such as lymphoma, are usually T2 hyperintense. Lymphoma also tends to be painless, in contrast to the presentation in this case. Metastases are often extraconal but can infiltrate into the intraconal region. They are not usually centred on the extraocular muscles and would also usually be T2 hyperintense. Rhabdomyosarcoma originates from the extraocular muscles but is usually a paediatric tumour, is usually T2 hyperintense and due to its aggressive nature may be associated with adjacent bone destruction",

      response: "",
      answer: "Artery of Adamkiewicz",
      explanation: "The distribution of neurological symptoms suggests an anterior spinal cord infarct. The artery of Adamkiewicz can have a variable origin usually arising between T9 and L2. It is the dominant arterial supply to the lumbosacral cord segments. Occlusion of this artery should be considered in patients with sudden onset chest pain caused by aortic dissection and evolving neurological symptoms. It can also be damaged during spinal surgery or abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. The artery of Percheron is variant anatomy of the posterior cerebral circulation which is characterised by a single artery arising from the posterior cerebral artery supplying the bilateral thalami and midbrain. The posterior spinal arteries are paired arteries arising from the vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar arteries and they supply the posterior columns of the spinal cord. Occlusion of these arteries can lead to contralateral loss of vibration, proprioception and two-point discrimination. The recurrent artery of Heubner is also known as the medial striate artery and can be seen on angiography as the largest perforating branch of the anterior cerebral artery, arising from the A1 or A2 segments",

      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Faecal calprotectin levels",
      explanation: "The question describes bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis with syndesmophytes which are also symmetrical and marginal. The differentials for bilateral symmetrical sacroiliitis include ankylosing spondylitis, inflammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Hyperparathyroidism can also mimic these appearances. With regard to syndesmophyte formation, they tend to either be non-marginal and asymmetric; for example in psoriatic and reactive arthritis, or marginal and symmetrical; for example in ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease. Therefore, the likely answers for this question would either be ankylosing spondylitis or inflammatory bowel disease. Ankylosing spondylitis is more common in males and you would expect other associated changes on radiographs of the spine. Therefore, inflammatory bowel disease is most likely to be the underlying diagnosis. Faecal calprotectin levels are commonly used in the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease. Anti-CCP levels are more sensitive and specific than rheumatoid factor (RF) in the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. HLA B27 is associated with the RF seronegative arthropathies including ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Parathyroid hormone levels could be investigated in suspected hyperparathyroidism, and punch skin biopsy is sometimes used to help diagnose psoriasis",

      response: "",
      answer: "Long axis of the distended loops arises from the right lower quadrant",
      explanation: "Differentiating sigmoid from caecal volvulus on plain abdominal radiograph can be challenging. However, it is important to distinguish between the two as the management can differ greatly. Typically caecal volvulus occurs in younger patients (30–60 years) than sigmoid volvulus. Radiographs shows marked caecal distension, preservation of haustral markings and the distended loop arises from the right lower quadrant and usually extends towards the left upper quadrant. Sometimes the caecum can twist axially and remain in the right lower quadrant. In contrast to this, the bowel wall in sigmoid volvulus is ahaustral and the bowel loop has a different position; it arises from the pelvis extending cranially towards the left hemidiaphragm. The apex of the loop can sometimes reach the level of the thoracic spine and overlaps the hepatic border. It has been described as a ‘coffee bean’ appearance",

      answer: "Maximum pressure generated of 120 mmHg within the colon",
      explanation: "Pneumatic reduction of intussusception is attempted to try and avoid the need for surgery; however, recurrence and procedural failure is possible. Most cases of recurrence reoccur within 72 hours. Contraindications include peritonitis, pneumoperitoneum and hypovolaemic shock. Children should be fluid resuscitated prior to attempting the procedure and a member of the surgical team should be present. The risks, as mentioned previously, are failure and recurrence as well as perforation. Pneumatic reduction is more likely to be successful if there is a shorter duration of symptoms (<24 hours) but longer than this is not a contraindication. Three attempts can be made, with three minutes between each attempt. The maximum pressure within the colon should not exceed 120 mmHg",

      answer: "Posterior midline diverticulum proximal to cricopharyngeus",
      explanation: "A pharyngeal pouch, otherwise known as a Zenker’s diverticulum, originates from the midline posteriorly above the level of cricopharyngeus. This is more common and more likely to be symptomatic than a Killian-Jamieson diverticulum which arises more laterally, often on the left side, and below cricopharyngeus. These are both examples of ‘false’ diverticula because the outpouching does not contain all layers of the oesophageal wall but is mucosa protruding through a muscular defect. A pulsion diverticulum is most commonly seen in the distal oesophagus and is associated with high pressures, for example in diffuse oesophageal spasm. The diverticulum may be present along with a ‘corkscrew oesophagus’ appearance",

      answer: "Contrast enhancement extending into the sulci",
      explanation: "Both lepto and pachymeningeal metastases are possible in breast cancer. Pachymeningeal disease is durally based and may be secondary to adjacent skull lesions or via lymphatic or haematogenous spread. The dura appears thickened around the brain in a curvilinear distribution and enhances following contrast. Leptomeningeal disease is characterised by fine nodular post contrast enhancement of the surface of the brain which, unlike pachymeningeal disease, extends into the sulci. Signal abnormality may also be evident on FLAIR and DWI/ADC sequences. It is sometimes described as having a ‘sugar coated’ appearance. It can be secondary to primary intracranial malignancies or secondary to haematogenous spread from primary cancers such as breast or lung. Parenchymal brain lesions are not a feature of either pachymeningeal or leptomeningeal diseasedisease; however, there may be associated adjacent cerebral oedema",
