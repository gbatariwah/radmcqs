After giving off the upper lobe bronchus, the main stem continues for 2.5cm, at which point the middle lobe bronchus arises on the anterior surface and the apical bronchus of the lower lobe arises on its posterior aspect. The middle lobe bronchus passes forwards and downwards, finally dividing into a lateral bronchus and medial bronchus, supplying a lateral and a medial segment in the middle lobe. The right bronchus ends by supplying the remaining four segments of the lower lobes: the anterior, posterior, medial, and lateral segments. On the left side, the main bronchus gives rise to the upper and lower lobe bronchus. The lingular bronchus arises from the upper lobe bronchus. The upper division bronchus supplies apical, posterior, and anterior segments. The lingular bronchus supplies a superior and inferior lingular segment. The left lower lobe bronchus divides to supply the apical, anterior, lateral, and posterior segments",

The arachnoid mater is a membrane that lies between the pia and dura mater. Spinal nerves C1-7 exit above the pedicle of the corresponding vertebra, whereas all the other nerves exit below the pedicle.
