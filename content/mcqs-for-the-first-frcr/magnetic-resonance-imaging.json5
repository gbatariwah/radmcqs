          "explanation": "They consist of STIR type fat signal suppression (inversion-recovery), and suppression of the water signal by selective saturation pulse centred on its resonance frequency peak. This enables the differentiation of silicone (which is also a high signal on T2) and water. This is particularly useful to detect implant rupture"
