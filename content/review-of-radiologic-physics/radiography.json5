      options: ["high; high", "high; low", "low; high", "low; low"],
      answer: "high; high",
      explanation: "Targets in x-ray tubes need a high atomic number Z to maximize Bremsstrahlung x-ray production and a high melting point to tolerate massive power loadings (e.g., 100 kW)",
      response: "",

        "Abdomen (pediatric)",
        "Abdomen (adult)",
      ],
      answer: "Extremity (tibia)",
      explanation: "To get the best resolution for detection of hairline fractures, extremity x-rays would use a small focal spot. In pediatric abdomen, short exposures are critical which requires the highest focal loadings that necessitate large focal spots",
      response: "",

      preamble: "Which radiographic examination is most likely to use a SID of 50 cm",
      options: ["Extremity", "Pediatric", "C-spine", "Not used"],
      answer: "Not used",
      explanation: "100 cm is the source to image receptor distance for the overwhelming majority of x-ray radiographs, but longer distances may be used for chest x-rays and C-spines. SIDs less than 100 cm are not used in radiography, although 65 cm is used in mammography",

      answer: "10 El",
      explanation: "Exposure index in extremity imaging is typically 1,000, three times higher than body radiography (low-energy x-rays deposit less energy in detectors which is why higher Els are used)",

      ],
      answer: "Added filtration",
      explanation: "More filtration (e.g., 0.1 mm Cu) is added in pediatric radiography to reduce doses which can be tolerated as small patients don't need high x-ray tube outputs",
