Poliomyelitis can cause atrophy of the overlying pectoral muscles. MacLeod's syndrome is a late sequel of childhood bronchiolitis with a small lung, small pulmonary arteries and expiratory air trapping on the affected side. If there is an embolus lodged in a major pulmonary artery, the vessels distal to the obstruction will be underperfused with associated loss of lung volume",

      explanation: "A transudate is defined as a fluid collection with a low protein concentration (< 30 g/L), whereas an exudate has a high protein concentration (> 30 g/L). Cardiac failure increases the capillary hydrostatic pressure which forces protein-poor fluid across intact membranes. Any pathological process that leads to damage of cell membranes will allow the passage of protein macromolecules through the membrane and consequently an exudate",

      answer: "Elevated left ventricular apex",
      explanation: "Coarctation of the aorta is associated with inferior rib notching (which takes several years to develop) and the resultant hypertension often produces left ventricular hypertrophy. The first two ribs are generally spared as the intercostal arteries are supplied via the costocervical trunk proximal to the coarctation and therefore do not contribute to the collateral circulation",
