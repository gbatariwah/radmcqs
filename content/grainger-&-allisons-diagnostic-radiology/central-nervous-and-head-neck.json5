      explanation: "An acquired cholesteatoma is a mass of epithelial debris within the middle ear, leading to conductive hearing loss. It can result in several complications: destruction of the ossicles, destruction of the tegmen tympani causing a cerebral abscess or meningitis, labyrinthine fistula due to erosion of the lateral semicircular canal and facial paralysis secondary to facial nerve involvement",

        "Dural thickening and multiple small meningeal masses",
        "High signal on T2w images in the periventricular white matter especially around the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles and in the basal ganglia",

      answer: "Orbital varix",
      explanation: "A varix is a dilated vein or group of veins. The usual presentation is that of intermittent proptosis which is caused by the Valsalva maneuver or postural change (due to an increase in intracranial pressure). Calcified phleboliths are pathognomonic if present",
