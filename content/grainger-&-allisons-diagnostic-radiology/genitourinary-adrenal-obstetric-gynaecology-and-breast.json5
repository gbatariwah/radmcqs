      explanation: "Diastolic flow reversal in the renal arcuate arteries on spectral Doppler ultrasound is a feature of renal vein thrombosis. Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and acute rejection are difficult to distinguish on a single Doppler examination because they both cause an increase in the resistive index (> 0.8).

The presence of substantial amounts of intracellular fat is critical in making the specific diagnosis of adenoma. Up to 30% of adenomas, however, do not have abundant intracellular fat and, thus, show attenuation values greater than 10 HU on unenhanced CT. Lesions above 10 HU on an unenhanced CT are considered indeterminate and other investigations may be required",

The reporting radiologist notes an incidental finding of a bulky prostate gland. On axial CT images, which one of the following CT findings is an unequivocal feature of prostatic enlargement?",
      options: [
        "The diaphragmatic urethra is dilated. (Dilatation)",
        "The prostate is identified 1 cm above the symphysis pubis",

      answer: "The prostate is identified 2—3 cm above the symphysis pubis",
      explanation: "On CT, as a general rule, the prostate is not considered to be enlarged if an image obtained 1 cm above the symphysis does not include the prostate. Unequivocal enlargement of the prostate is diagnosed if the prostate is seen in images 2—3 cm or more above the symphysis pubis",

The patient is a teacher and has recently returned to the UI< after 15 years working in Malawi. He suffered an episode of dysuria and haematuria several years ago, and a local doctor diagnosed schistosomiasis. You are asked to supervise and report a CT urogram for this patient. Which one of the following statements is true regarding the radiological features of schistosomiasis?",
