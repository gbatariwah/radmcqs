A large HCC will usually demonstrate heterogeneous reflectivity due to areas of necrosis, but smaller lesions are typically of homogeneous low reflectivity on ultrasound. HCC often invades the branches of the portal vein and the most frequent site of metastases is the lungs. Metastases to the brain are typically hypervascular and do not usually contain calcification",
