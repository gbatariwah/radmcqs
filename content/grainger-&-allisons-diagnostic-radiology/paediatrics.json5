      options: [
        "Calcification of the optic tract on CT would suggest an optic nerve glioma",
        "Extension of the tumor into the subarachnoid space is recognized",
        "On T1-weighted images, optic nerve gliomas yield high signal",
        "Optic nerve gliomas are usually nonenhancing",
        "The commonest location of an optic pathway glioma is within the optic chiasm",

      response: "",
      answer: "Extension of the tumor into the subarachnoid space is recognized",
      explanation: "Optic pathway gliomas are the most commonly seen intracranial abnormality in NF1. The commonest location in children is within the optic nerve rather than the chiasm",

        "Adult appearances of the corpus callosum are not expected",
        "It is possible to assess myelination accurately using T1-weighted images alone",
        "On T1-weighted images, myelination will have almost reached adult maturity by imaging criteria",

      response: "",
      answer: "On T1-weighted images, myelination will have almost reached adult maturity by imaging criteria",
      explanation: "During the first 6 months of life, brain maturation is easiest to follow on T1w images, where the appearance of myelin is bright. By 10 months the T1w images will have an almost adult appearance, and further changes are easier to assess using the T2w images",
