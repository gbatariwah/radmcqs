From an initial reconstruction, the image is segmented to identify areas of bone. The beam hardening effects of the bone are modelled and used to pre-correct the data. This process may be repeated iteratively to produce a final image essentially free from beam hardening artefacts. However, the reconstructing time is consequently increased"

In many modern scanners, the tube current (mA) can be varied as the gantry rotates around the patient. A higher mA is used for the more attenuating projections and a lower mA for the less attenuating projections. The mA to be used is calculated either in advance from analysis of the scout view or during the scan via a feedback system from the detector"
