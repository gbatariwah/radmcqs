          "response": "",
          "answer": "False",
          "explanation": "There is no known way of measuring each voxel independently. Each pencil beam (the part of the beam falling on one particular detector) at each angle measures the total attenuation of all the voxels it has passed through. When this information from many different angles has been analysed using complex algorithms, the attenuation coefficient for each particular voxel can be calculated"

The overlying structures in conventional radiography significantly reduce the potential for contrast resolution"
