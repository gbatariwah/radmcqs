      response: "",
      answer: "Chordoma",
      explanation: "Plain film is very insensitive for detecting sacral lesions. Metastatic disease is much more common in the sacrum than primary malignancy. Chordoma is the most common primary sacral lesion. It is derived from the embryonic remnants of the notochord and is thus almost always found in the midline or a paramedian location with respect to the spine. It is most commonly found in the sacrum (50%), clivus (35%), and vertebrae (15%). A chordoma manifests as a destructive, lytic lesion, commonly with internal calcifications, at both plain radiography and CT. A large presacral soft-tissue component is usually present, as are soft-tissue components within the sacrum and sacral canal. Symptoms can include pain, sciatica, and rectal bleeding as well as other bowel and bladder symptoms, reflecting compromise of sacral nerves. The tumors can extend across the adjacent disc space and sacroiliac joint. On MRI, chordomas demonstrate low to intermediate signal intensity on T1WI and prominent increased signal intensity on T2WI. Enhancement of the soft-tissue components is variable, yet often moderate, on both CT and MR images. Chordomas demonstrate a prominent vascular stain at angiography. They are locally aggressive and develop in locations that do not permit easy surgical cure. There is an almost 100% recurrence rate; tumor seeding along biopsy tracts and surgical incisions can lead to multicentric local recurrences. Metastasis occurs in 5–43% to liver, lung, regional lymph nodes, peritoneum, skin, and heart. The 5-year survival rate is 66% for adults. Osteomyelitis in the sacrum is most often due to contiguous spread from a suppurative focus and we are told this patient was previously well. Ewing sarcoma would occur at a younger age (peaking at 15 years, 90% manifest between the ages of 5 and 30). In the case of myeloma it would be atypical for the rest of the spine to be uninvolved. The sacrococcygeal region is the most common location of teratomas discovered in infancy. It is only rarely discovered in adulthood. Teratomas are composed of a mixture of cystic and solid components. The other lesions to be included in the differential diagnosis of such a sacral mass are metastasis, sarcomas, GCT, chondrosarcoma, and ependymoma",

      response: "",
      answer: "Psoriatic arthropathy",
      explanation: "Bone involvement before skin changes is evident in up to 20% of cases. Nail pitting or discoloration is common and correlated with the severity of the arthropathy. Five distinct manifestations have been described: oligoarthritis, polyarthritis (predominately distal IP joints), symmetric type (resembling RA), arthritis mutilans, and spondyloarthropathy. The characteristic distribution involves the small joints of the hands and feet, with or without spondyloarthropathy. Involvement in the hands tends to include distal IP as well as MCP or PIP joints, with early tuft resorption and distal IP erosive disease. The erosions become so severe that a ‘pencil-in-cup’ deformity and telescoping of the joint may occur. Bone density can be normal and the joint distribution is asymmetric. Similarly, sacroiliitis is asymmetric, unlike ankylosing spondylitis and syndesmophtes, which are non-marginal and asymmetric; in ankylosing spondylitis they are marginal and asymmetric. The spondyloarthropathy of psoriatric arthropathy is indistinguishable from that of reactive arthritis, the clinical scenario (rash vs uveitis/urethritis) providing the diagnosis. The arthropathies of CPPD disease and haemochromatosis are essentially identical radiographically. Chondrocalcinosis is commonly seen in the wrist (triangular fibrocartilage) and knee (menisci). The joints most affected are the knee, wrist and second and third MCPs of the hand: the IP joints tend to be spared. Early disease shows erosive change. More advanced disease demonstrates sclerosis, osteochondral fragments, and osteophytes. Subchondral cysts are common and large. RA is rarely found in the distal IP joints and periosteal reaction is not a feature. SLE is usually non-erosive and affects the MCP joints",

An x-ray of the lumbar spine demonstrates a slight scoliosis, with an enlarged sclerotic left pedicle of L3.

      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Osteoblastoma",
      explanation: "Osteoblastoma is similar both clinically and histologically to osteoid osteoma, but there are some differences that aid in distinguishing these two entities. Clinically osteoblastoma is typically less painful than osteoid osteoma and does not respond as well to salicylates. An osteoblastoma in the neural arch of the spine is more likely to cause neurological signs, as these lesions are typically larger and more expansile than osteoid osteoma. The lucent nidus seen in osteoid osteoma is usually less than 1.5–2 cm in size, whereas the nidus in osteoblastoma is usually larger than 2 cm at diagnosis and has less surrounding sclerosis. The nidus may or may not have a calcified focus within, in both these diagnoses. The appearance described in the question is the subgroup of osteoblastoma that has similar features to osteoid osteoma. Other appearances on imaging of osteoblastoma include an expansile lesion with multiple small calcifications and a peripheral sclerotic rim or, more rarely, an aggressive appearance with osseous expansion, bone destruction, infiltrating soft tissue, and intermixed matrix calcification. An enostosis (or bone island) may be giant (greater than 2 cm), but should be well defined and densely sclerotic. It is possible a bone abscess could cause a lytic lesion with surrounding sclerosis, but the patient is systemically well, making infection less likely. A bone abscess is also unlikely to be as expansile as the lesion described. Intracortical haemangioma is a very rare diagnosis, usually within the cortex of a long bone, such as the tibia. On CT there is a hypoattenuating lesion, with spotty internal calcification or a ‘wire-netting’ appearance",

      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "Giant cell tumour (GCT)",
      explanation: "This is the classical description and location of a GCT. They occur age 20–40 years, in the long bones and occasionally the sacrum and pelvis. They are lucent, eccentric, and expansile but do not usually produce sclerosis and produce a periosteal reaction in less than a third of patients. They may have a multiloculated appearance. They originate in the metaphysis but extend to the subchondral surface in the skeletally mature. MRI often reveals fluid–fluid levels and some low signal on T2WI due to haemosiderin or collagen deposition. The major differential diagnosis is an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC), but this classically has a sclerotic margin and usually occurs under 30 years of age (75% occur before the age of 20 years). Fibrous dysplasia would usually present at a younger age in the metaphysis with extension into the diaphysis; a trabeculated/ground-glass appearance is typical with a thick sclerotic margin and endosteal scalloping. Metastasis would be relatively rare at this age and there is no mention of a primary tumor. Osteosarcoma would have a more aggressive appearance with a wide zone of transition, periosteal reaction, cortical destruction, and soft tissue extension. Dähnert W.

      answer: "Fracture of the proximal third",
      explanation: "Scaphoid fracture is the most common of all carpal bone fractures and also potentially serious due to the high rate of avascular necrosis. This fracture can be difficult to detect on initial radiographs. Wrist casting and repeat radiography after 1 week are typically advised if there is ongoing suspicion. Fractures of the proximal third account for 20% of injuries, but are associated with failure to unite in 90%. Middle third fractures make up the majority (70%), with up to 30% failing to reunite. Distal third fractures usually reunite. A vertical oblique fracture is more unstable than a horizontal oblique fracture. Fracture displacement of greater than 1mm is also a poor prognostic feature",

There are a number of unusual findings, which if present should indicate a diagnosis other than RA. Productive bone change (e.g. periostitis or enthesopathy) is extremely unusual. Osteophytes are also uncommon in the absence of advanced associated osteoarthritic change. The exception to this is the distal ulna, a feature known as ulnar capping.

      response: "",
      answer: "GCT of the tendon sheath",
      explanation: "A GCT of the tendon sheath is a nodular form of PVNS. These tumors are intimately associated with a tendon sheath and are most commonly located in the hand. They usually manifest as a small slow-growing mass, with or without pain. Radiographs may show no abnormality or non-aggressive remodeling of the adjacent bone. These lesions are typically hypo- or isointense to muscle on T1WI and T2WI, owing to abundant collagen and hemosiderin, often with enhancement. This is similar to the findings of diffuse intra-articular PVNS, when the extent of hemosiderin deposition may cause hypointense nodules on T2WI and blooming artifact on gradient echo (GE) sequences. It must be stated that the degree of hemosiderin content may not always be enough to cause marked hypointensity on T2WI in GCT of the tendon sheath. A ganglion cyst could occur in this location and be related to a tendon sheath, but on MRI it is typically hyperintense on T2WI secondary to its fluid component. There may be thin rim enhancement of the wall post administration of gadolinium. Peripheral nerve sheath tumors are typically hyperintense on T2WI with variable contrast enhancement. Lipomas are similar in signal characteristic to subcutaneous fat on MRI, i.e. hyperintense on both T1WI and T2WI. A soft-tissue hemangioma may contain phleboliths on plain radiographic imaging. On MRI, hemangiomas may be well circumscribed or have poorly defined margins, with varying amounts of increased T1WI signal owing to either reactive fat overgrowth or hemorrhage. Areas of slow flow are typically hyperintense on T2WI, while rapid flow can demonstrate a signal void on images obtained with a non-flow-sensitive sequence",

This injury usually requires internal fixation to secure the ligament. Radial collateral ligament injuries of the thumb lead to painful deformity and articular degeneration. Rupture of flexor pollicis longus results in loss of active flexion of the thumb. The thumb remains in flexion with rupture of extensor pollicis longus.

The highly structured collagen matrix has tightly bound protons that do not resonate or produce significant signal. As a result, the marrow is of diffuse low signal intensity on all sequences. There is also no architectural distortion. In contrast, myeloma, metastases, and lymphoma are generally associated with focal or multifocal signal abnormalities. Sickle-cell anemia causes bone sclerosis secondary to bone infarcts, which have an irregular appearance. In myelofibrosis, splenomegaly is secondary to extramedullary hematopoiesis.

      explanation: "The others are more in keeping with benign compression fractures. Retropulsion of a posterior fragment into the spinal canal is a highly specific (100%) finding of benign compression fracture, but has a sensitivity of only 16%. Other features in keeping with malignant compression fractures are complete replacement of normal marrow with low signal on T1WI, involvement of the pedicles, and the presence of an epidural and/or paraspinal soft-tissue mass. The presence of an epidural mass is said to have 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity for malignant fractures.

      answer: "Aggressive granulomatous disease",
      explanation: "Well-delineated, rounded, focal areas of lucency at the cement bone interface, which are progressive, are suggestive of either infection or aggressive granulomatous disease. It can occur with both cemented and non-cemented components. Its origin is thought to be multifactorial. Metal, cement, or polyethylene fragments may penetrate the cement bone interface and induce a focal inflammatory foreign-body reaction, leading to osteolysis. Primary loosening usually manifests as a wide (>2 mm) radiolucent zone at the cement–bone or metal–bone interface or a progressive radiolucent zone at the metal–cement interface. The radiolucent zones are not typically rounded. Cement fractures are thin linear lucent areas within the cement. They may be asymptomatic, but are important to identify as they may lead to component failure. Metal bead shedding is defined as opaque microfragments separated from the porous coated femoral stem. Metal beads can be seen on immediate postoperative radiographs, as a consequence of the stem insertion. Bead shedding might later occur with loose non-cemented components, reflecting micro-motion of the stem. These metal beads are seen in the soft tissue adjacent to the hip replacement and their increase in number on follow-up indicates loosening",

      response: "",
      answer: "Bruising at the anterior aspect of the tibia",
      explanation: "Such bruising occurs in a dashboard injury when a posteriorly directed force is applied to the anterior aspect of the proximal tibia with the knee in flexion, such as occurs in an RTA. Bruising is also occasionally found in the posterior patella in this situation. Associated soft-tissue injuries are disruption of the posterior capsule and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). The pattern of injury in option A is caused by the pivot shift injury (valgus load in flexion combined with external rotation of the tibia or internal rotation of the femur). This will result in anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) disruption and the resultant anterior subluxation of the tibia causes impaction of the lateral femoral condyle against the posterolateral margin of the lateral tibial plateau. Soft-tissue injuries that may occur are tears of the posterior capsule, the posterior horn of the lateral or medial meniscus, and the medial collateral ligament (MCL). The kissing contusions in option C are as a result of hyperextension injury; resulting injuries may be to the ACL, PCL, or menisci. Option D describes the pattern found in clip injury, which involves a pure valgus stress while the knee is in mild flexion. The second area of bruising in the medial femoral condyle in this situation is due to avulsive stress to the MCL.

Signal intensity changes in the spinal cord are seen in only 20% of preganglionic injuries and lack specificity. Intradural nerve root enhancement suggests functional impairment of the nerve roots, despite morphological continuity. This is not a common finding. T2WI signal intensity changes within the paraspinal muscles are observed in nerve root avulsion, but this is less accurate than enhancement on T1WI post contrast. Abnormal enhancement within the multifidus muscle is the most accurate of all paraspinal muscle findings since it is innervated by a single nerve root. Thickening of the brachial plexus, secondary to oedema and fibrosis, is seen in postganglionic injury. Traumatic pseudomeningocoele, although not pathognomonic, is the most valuable sign of a preganglionic lesion",

The central dystrophic calcification seen in approximately 62% of cases is considered pathognomic. The major differential diagnosis of this lesion is a simple bone cyst, although this would not contain central calcification. Unlike bone cysts elsewhere, it is seen at this site into adulthood. Also within the differential diagnosis is a pseudolesion within the calcaneus, caused by a relative paucity of trabecular bone at the same location. Again, central calcification would not be a feature in this phenomenon.

      explanation: "While the Kellegren and Lawrence grading of OA is the most widely used scale for grading OA on plain films, early osteophyte formation is not definitively 'arthritic' change. Studies have shown that patients with this type of early change infrequently progress to developing more severe disease. Recent research in OA is focused on the impact of the subchondral bone on the disease, rather than hyaline cartilage. This is evidenced by increased uptake on bone scan being closely linked to progressive OA, even in patients with relatively normal joints on plain film. The foci of high signal on T2WI and STIR are bone marrow lesions that if persistent can indicate pathology in the subchondral bone, which can lead to arthritic change. The serpiginous line describes the classical finding of avascular necrosis. Both this and osteochondral defects lead to progressive OA change",

      response: "",
      answer: "Use fast spin echo (FSE) imaging rather than GE imaging",
      explanation: "Magnetization of the implant affects the local field gradient, proton dephasing, and spin frequency, resulting in signal void, spatial distortion, and spurious high signal. The lack of a 180° rephasing pulse in GE sequences, as opposed to SE/FSE sequences, means that T2* effects are not reversed and a greater dephasing of spins occurs in GE than in SE/FSE techniques. Thus GE techniques have a greater sensitivity to magnetic susceptibility effects. This is detrimental when imaging patients with metal prostheses, but can be used to advantage in certain clinical situations, e.g. when identifying subtle haemorrhage due to the magnetic susceptibility effects of iron in haemosiderin (a blood breakdown product). Magnetic susceptibility artefacts are increased with higher field strengths. Positioning the long axis of the prosthesis parallel to the main magnetic field direction (β0) reduces susceptibility artefact. Spectral fat suppression is particularly susceptible to metallic artefact and should be avoided in favor of STIR, where some of the dephasing of proton spins, due to magnetic field inhomogeneity, is refocused by the 180° inversion pulse. Reducing the number of voxels (increasing spatial resolution) reduces diffusion-related signal intensity loss. It also reduces the spatial definition of the signal void and therefore leads to a reduction in the apparent size of the void",

Greater arc injuries are twice as frequent as lesser arc injuries. When describing these injuries the fracture is named first with the prefix ‘trans’ followed by the dislocation. Trans-scaphoid perilunate dislocation is the most common type of perilunate injury. Fractures of the trapezium, capitate, hamate, and triquetrum are also part of the greater arc injuries. Other radiographic signs of this injury include disruption of the carpal (Gilula) arcs and a triangular lunate on the AP view.

The technique involves injection of diluted gadolinium mixed with iodinated contrast, which allows fluoroscopic confirmation of intra-articular needle placement. Partial and full thickness tears may not be distinguishable on standard T1WI because fat and gadolinium have similar signal intensities. This is especially the case when cuff tendons show contrast solution extending to the bursal surface but not definitively through it. This problem can be overcome with the use of fat suppression. MR arthrography should include a T2WI sequence to identify bursal fluid collections and tears. T2WI is also helpful in characterizing incidental bone marrow lesions. Inadvertent injection of gas may lead to a false-positive diagnosis of intra-articular loose bodies, but gas bubbles will rise to non-dependent regions, whereas loose bodies will gravitate to dependent locations.

      answer: "Insufficiency fractures",
      explanation: "This patient has developed osteoporosis due to heparin administration (and with age). This has resulted in thoracic kyphosis and the ‘H’ sign of increased uptake within the sacral body and alae, which is classical of insufficiency fractures of the sacrum. Often there will have been relatively minor trauma that will not be reported by the patient, and there may be associated pubic rami fractures. Radiotherapy to the area (e.g. in gynaecological malignancy) is another predisposing factor. Multiple myeloma, metastases from renal cell carcinoma, and chordoma are typically osteolytic and result in osteopenia at isotope bone scan (IBS), although the investigation has poor sensitivity for myeloma. Brown tumours do cause increased uptake on IBS, but we are not given a history of renal failure or hyperparathyroidism to explain their presence. There is no history given to suggest infection. Bone metastases which cause an increased uptake on IBS are breast, prostate, lymphoma, pulmonary carcinoid, mucinous GI, and bladder tumours. Renal cell carcinoma, thyroid, and melanoma typically cause photopenia",

      response: "",
      answer: "Synovial osteochondromatosis",
      explanation: "The primary form of this represents an uncommon benign neoplastic process with hyaline cartilage nodules in the subsynovial tissue of a joint, tendon sheath, or bursa. Secondary synovial chondromatosis is associated with joint abnormalities, such as mechanical or arthritic conditions, that cause intraarticular chondral bodies. The primary form of the disease predominantly affects men in the third to fifth decades. The knee is the most common site, but it is also seen in the hip, shoulder, elbow, and ankle; less commonly the MCP, IP, distal radioulnar, and acromioclavicular joints are involved. It can rarely involve extra-articular sites, the synovium about the tendons, or bursa. Clinical symptoms typically include pain, swelling, and restriction of the range of motion of the joint. Radiologic findings are frequently pathognomonic. Radiographs reveal multiple intraarticular calcifications (70–95% of cases) of similar size and shape distributed throughout the joint, with typical ‘ring-and-arc’ chondroid mineralization. Extrinsic erosion of bone is seen in 20–50% of cases. Juxtaarticular osteopenia is not typically apparent in synovial chondromatosis unless it is the result of disuse. CT is often diagnostic if the bodies are adequately mineralized and is particularly helpful for identifying characteristic ring-and-arc or punctate mineralization and the multiplicity of nodules in cases for which radiographic findings are normal or equivocal. Lack of mineralization of the bodies does occur in which cases MRI is very helpful to distinguish from, for example, PVNS or amyloid. The most common pattern on MRI (77% of cases) reveals low to intermediate signal intensity with T1WI and very high signal intensity with T2WI with hypointense calcifications",

      explanation: "Distinguishing recurrent metastases from rebound hematopoietic marrow is difficult on standard T1WI and T2WI sequences because both have intermediate signal intensity on T1WI and high signal intensity on T2WI. They may also occur in same anatomic regions. Out-of-phase GE imaging is useful in differentiating the two. Most neoplastic processes replace the marrow elements such as fat, osseous trabeculae, and hematopoietic elements, but hyperplastic red marrow does not. Out-of-phase imaging allows detection of intralesional fat by demonstrating a drop in signal intensity compared to in-phase images. Lengthening of echo results in loss of signal of rebound red marrow due to T2* dephasing, while the water-laden metastatic foci become more conspicuous",

A bipolar hemiarthroplasty comprises a combination of a femoral component articulating with a cup inserted into the native acetabulum without fixation. This cup is usually made of polyethylene with a metal backing and can normally move within the native acetabular cavity as a result of the absence of fixation. Hip resurfacing consists of replacing the surface of the femoral head by a metallic ‘cap’ without removing the femoral neck or instrumenting the femoral diaphysis. The cap used on the femoral head is virtually the same size as the natural head and articulates with an acetabular prosthetic cup, usually made of metal.

Radiographs demonstrate cortical thickening and lamellar periosteal proliferation in a diametaphyseal location. Bone scintigraphy will demonstrate patchy linear increased uptake along the cortical margins. Option B describes pachydermoperiostosis, a self-limited condition in adolescents. Option C is typical of thyroid acropachy. Cortical thickening and trabecular coarsening is a feature of Paget’s disease and symmetrical, solid periosteal new bone formation is described in hypervitaminosis A",

      options: ["Gout", "CPPD", "RA", "Amyloidosis", "Wilson’s disease"],
      response: "",
      answer: "Amyloidosis",
      explanation: "There are a lot of conditions that are capable of mimicking RA. In these cases a few key features can help reach a diagnosis. The classic finding in gout is of non-marginal erosions, as opposed to those described. Nevertheless, marginal erosions can occur with gout. An RA-type picture in the presence of non-marginal erosions or calcified soft-tissue nodules (tophi) should suggest this diagnosis. CPPD gives a more productive pattern of arthritis, such as seen with OA, affecting the radio-carpal joint. Thus, it is often suspected when the appearance is of OA with a ‘funny distribution’. Amyloidosis is suggested first by the history of MM. Involvement of the hands is more commonly seen in amyloid secondary to prolonged dialysis, but can be seen when the amyloid is secondary to MM, when the wrists are often affected. Amyloid can closely resemble RA in its distribution and the pattern of erosions. However, three important features can help differentiate: amyloidosis classically preserves the joint space, is not usually associated with periarticular osteopenia, and amyloidosis causes well-demarcated subchondral cyst formation in excess to that expected from the degree of joint disease",

      explanation: "Gaucher disease and SCD can both cause H-shaped vertebrae and avascular necrosis of the humeral heads, but Gaucher disease causes splenomegaly, whereas by adulthood SCD will usually have caused splenic infarction, resulting in a small, calcified spleen. Films illustrating the complications of these diseases are beloved by examiners in the 2B exam: remember to look for the mediastinal mass (extramedullary haematopoiesis) and AVN of the proximal humeri on the chest film. Other musculoskeletal manifestations of SCD include osteomyelitis (particularly salmonella species), septic arthritis, and medullary bone infarcts. Infarction in SCD is common throughout the body and is responsible for the acute pain crisis. Infarction can occur in the liver, spleen, and kidneys, and can result in stroke. Scheuermann’s disease is osteochondrosis of the apophyses of the thoracic vertebrae and results in end-plate irregularity, Schmorl’s nodes, loss of disc space, and kyphosis. True H-shaped vertebrae are not a feature. Hereditary spherocytosis is an autosomal dominant condition. It produces splenomegaly and, as with other haematological conditions, can result in widening of the diploic spaces of the skull. Primary bone lymphoma typically appears as a solitary focal lesion with an aggressive appearance",

      answer: "Calcaneal fracture classification is based on fracture location at the posterior facet",
      explanation: "Calcaneal fractures represent 60% of fractures involving the tarsal bones. Axial loading resulting from a fall from a height is the most common cause followed by motor vehicle accidents. Treatment is based on accurate evaluation and classification of calcaneal fractures using multidetector CT reformats. Calcaneal fractures are classified into intra-articular and extra-articular based on the involvement of the posterior facet of the subtalar joint. Intra-articular fractures, accounting for 75% of all calcaneal fractures, are further classified into four types depending on the number of fracture lines and fragments. Extra-articular fractures are classified into three types depending on whether the fracture involves the anterior, middle, or posterior aspect of calcaneus. Bilateral fractures are seen in less than 10% of cases. Approximately 10% of calcaneal fractures are associated with compression injuries of the spine, commonly at the thoracolumbar junction. Boehler’s angle is formed by the intersection of (a) a line from the highest point of the posterior calcaneal tuberosity to the highest point of the posterior facet and (b) a line from the latter point to the highest of the anterior process. Normal Boehler’s angle is 20–40°. An angle less than 20° indicates collapse of the posterior facet. The sustentaculum tali is an eminence on the medial aspect of the calcaneus bearing the middle facet of subtalar joint",

      explanation: "This is a complicated question, but one that is frequently posed to musculoskeletal radiologists. A full description is beyond the remit of this section and the reader is referred to the excellent synopsis referenced below. Basically the foot is divided into the hind foot and fore foot when assessing for congenital abnormalities. The tibio-calcaneal angle (angle made by a line drawn along the length of both bones) should be between 60° and 90°. Less than this is due to abnormal dorsiflexion (e.g. as seen with congenital vertical talus, or rocker bottom foot) and more is due to equinus deformity. Secondly, the degree of hindfoot varus or valgus is assessed. The talo-calcaneal angle (on a frontal hindfoot x-ray, this is the angle between the lines drawn along the length of each bone) should be between 15° and 40°; less is varus deformity and more is valgus. On the lateral view, the forefoot can be roughly assessed with two observations. Normally the metatarsals overlap. However, if the first metatarsal is the most plantar, then forefoot valgus is present (as the foot is too flat). If the metatarsals are not superimposed, then varus is present. The final step is to remember the features of the common conditions. These are clubfoot (hindfoot equinus and varus), pes planovalgus (hind foot and fore foot valgus, not equinus), and pes cavus (hindfoot valgus)",

      answer: "Kidneys",
      explanation: "A superscan refers to a 99mTc-labelled technetium IBS where there is diffuse increased osseous uptake with apparent reduced renal and soft tissue uptake. The appearance is commonly due to widespread osteoblastic bony metastases (e.g. prostate or breast carcinoma), but is also caused by non-malignant disease (e.g. renal osteodystrophy, hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia, myelofibrosis, Paget’s disease). In metastatic disease, there is usually higher uptake in the axial than the appendicular skeleton. In IBS uptake is normally seen in bone, kidneys, and bladder, soft tissues (low levels), breasts (particularly in young women), and epiphyses (skeletally immature patients). Uptake is seen in the myocardium (high), brain (high), and bowel (moderate) in FDG-PET scanning, not IBS; however myocardial uptake on IBS can be seen in cases of recent myocardial infarction and amyloidosis. Note that poor renal function can often demonstrate reduced or absent renal visualization producing an appearance similar to a superscan (false positive), whereas urinary tract obstruction in prostatic carcinoma can increase renal activity and lead to false negative scans",

This pattern of skeletal abnormalities is seen with the mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), although it can also be seen with other storage disorders. With the exception of Hurler’s syndrome, where the manifestations are present at 1 year of age, the skeletal manifestations progress as the patients get older. Hurler’s and Morquio’s are the most common of the MPS conditions. Amongst the MPS conditions, Morquio’s stands out as a favorite for single best answer (SBA) and viva questions as it is the only MPS where the patient is not intellectually impaired. It also displays a central anterior vertebral body beak, whereas the other conditions have an anterior beak in the lower third of the vertebral body. The differences with achondroplasia are the progression with age and the pelvic shape. The pelvis in achondroplasia has widened iliac wings, with horizontal acetabular roofs and a narrow inlet, giving the classic ‘champagne glass’ appearance.

      answer: "PVNS",
      explanation: "This is a monoarticular tumor-like proliferation of synovium that occurs in joints, bursae, and tendon sheaths. It may be focal or diffuse. It occurs most frequently in the knee (80% of cases), then the hip, ankle, shoulder, and elbow. The abnormal synovium is prone to hemorrhage, thus producing blooming artifact on GE sequences, secondary to hemosiderin deposition. In general, the classic MRI appearance is variable low signal intensity on all sequences (T2WI signal being more variable due to fat, edema, and blood products). Early changes involve a focal mass and joint effusion. Subsequently large erosions, synovial hypertrophy, and subchondral cysts may occur. Joint space is preserved until advanced disease is present and bone density is normal. After IV contrast at CT, PVNS shows variable enhancement, which can be striking. The differential diagnosis includes diseases causing recurrent hemarthroses, e.g. hemophilia and hemochromatosis (PVNS is monoarticular) as well as gout, amyloid, synovial chondromatosis, and tuberculosis. Some 90% of synovial cell sarcomas do not originate from a joint. They are usually isointense to muscle on T1WI, with heterogeneous high-signal intensity on T2WI. Regional migratory osteoporosis would obviously involve loss of bone mineralization, as well as marrow edema. Gout demonstrates typically ‘rat’s bite’ para-articular erosions and soft-tissue calcification; when it involves the knee it tends to affect the patello-femoral compartment",
