      questionNumber: 1,
      stem: "A 9-year-old male presents to the paediatric A&E department with a history of increasing drowsiness over the last 24 hours. Neurological assessment reveals that there is absence of upward gaze. A CT brain is requested which reveals hydrocephalus, with marked dilatation of the lateral and third ventricles. The fourth ventricle is unremarkable and there is obliteration of the ambient cistern due to mass effect from a hyperdense mass noted posterior to the third ventricle. This mass has some central areas of calcification. There is no evidence of haemorrhage. An MRI is carried out following insertion of a shunt to decompress the ventricles. On sagittal sequences a lesion is located between the splenium of the corpus callosum and the tectal plate, which exerts mass effect. This lesion is of intermediate signal intensity on both T1WI and T2WI, and displays avid contrast enhancement. Enhancing meningeal lesions are also noted in the spinal cord, indicating seeding. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      response: "",
      answer: "Germinoma",
      explanation: "The lesion is described in the pineal region, so the differential of pineal tumours should be considered. These are differentiated between germ cell tumours and pineal cell tumours. Germinomas account for 40% of all pineal region masses and are much more frequent in males than females. They are also the most common germ cell tumour, with teratomas and choriocarcinoma having different imaging characteristics. The main differential in this case is between pineoblastoma and germinoma, as both occur in patients of this age group and both are hyperdense on CT. Imaging features described to help differentiate are the avid enhancement, which is more characteristic of germinomas, but can occur in either. Central calcification is seen commonly in germinomas, but is uncommon in pineoblastomas, and when it occurs is often peripheral, giving the impression of an ‘exploded’ pineal gland. Subarachnoid seeding is seen in both tumours and if present CSF sampling can yield a tissue diagnosis. Pineocytomas occur in an older age group and infrequently cause subarachnoid seeding",

      response: "",
      answer: "Symmetrical involvement of cerebral white matter",
      explanation: "Symmetrical involvement of the cerebral hemispheres or cerebellar peduncles is unusual in MS and is occasionally seen in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). ADEM can mimic an acute presentation of MS both clinically and in terms of imaging findings. The monophasic nature of ADEM can be deduced both from the uniformity of lesional oedema and contrast enhancement in the acute phase. Lesions in ADEM resolve on follow-up, and although enhancing and non-enhancing lesions can coexist for a period, new lesions should not appear. MS plaques are classically seen in the periventricular and juxtacortical white matter. The other options in the question are all common plaque locations. Involvement of the corpus callosum is characteristic. Other common supratentorial sites include the white matter abutting the temporal horns and trigones of the lateral ventricles. Cortical lesions are less conspicuous on MRI than white matter lesions, but their detection is improved by the inclusion of a FLAIR sequence. Juxtacortical white matter lesions are highly suggestive of MS, as lesions are not commonly seen in this region in normal ageing. Twelve per cent of patients have lesions on MRI limited to the spine without brain involvement",

      explanation: "The answer options give some of the classical radiological differentials for a ring-enhancing lesion in the brain: MAGIC DR (metastasis, abscess, glioblastoma multiforme, infarct, contusion, demyelinating conditions and post-radiotherapy change). The clinical history should steer the reader toward the first two. DWI is reasonably useful at differentiating between these two (exceptions being in some fungal infections and toxoplasmosis), with necrotic metastasis having unrestricted diffusion and abscess having restricted diffusion. The appearances in this case are slightly confused by the DWI b1000 imaging showing increased signal. However, the presence of increased signal on the ADC map correctly identifies this as being T2 shine through, showing the importance of checking both sequences",

      answer: "Oligodendroglioma",
      explanation: "Prior to evaluating the imaging characteristics, the patient’s demographics should be considered in this case, as in all cases of intracranial masses, as it will help limit the differential diagnosis significantly. The patient is an adult, thus making DIG and DNET unlikely. Secondly, consider the temporal lobe location. Haemangioblastomas are usually infratentorial in location, especially in the absence of a history of von Hippel–Lindau syndrome. All the other lesions are classical temporal lobe tumours. Finally, considering the imaging characteristics, both PXA and oligodendrogliomas may be entirely solid, but cysts are commonly seen in PXAs. Calcification is seen in 60–80% of oligodendrogliomas, but is rarely seen in PXAs. Similarly haemorrhage, while not typical of oligodendrogliomas, is rare in PXAs",

      response: "",
      answer: "Normal surrounding brain parenchyma",
      explanation: "Perivascular spaces (Virchow–Robin spaces) are pial lined interstitial fluid structures that accompany penetrating arteries, but do not communicate directly with the subarachnoid space. They can occur anywhere, but typically cluster around the anterior commissure. They follow CSF signal intensity, suppress on FLAIR, and do not exhibit restricted diffusion. They can occasionally be giant when located within the midbrain. Lacunar infarcts will also be hypointense on T1WI and hyperintense on T2WI. Restricted diffusion will be seen when acute/subacute. They are typically of increased signal on FLAIR, although will suppress if there is central encephalomalacia. A halo of surrounding high signal on T2WI and FLAIR is typical of lacunar infarction, although up to 25% of prominent perivascular spaces can also demonstrate a slight halo of increased signal. Lacunar infarcts are also more typically seen in the setting of more extensive white matter disease",

      answer: "Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome",
      explanation: "This syndrome is characterized by retinal lesions variously described as being retinal angiomas, retinal haemangiomas, or retinal hamartomas. These lesions (Lindau tumours) cause retinal calcification, although this is also seen in NF-1 and tuberous sclerosis (TS) from other causes. The findings describe the classical appearance of a cerebellar haemangioblastoma. These lesions can also be entirely cystic or solid in a minority of cases. A signal void and lack of dural enhancement help differentiate this from other infratentorial masses in adults. Twenty per cent of haemangioblastomas are associated with Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome and 80% of Von Hippel–Lindau syndrome patients have this tumour. The spinal finding also indicates a further haemangioblastoma in the cord. Unlike in the posterior fossa, these seldom have flow voids, but are associated with the development of a syrinx",

      answer: "Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)",
      explanation: "This is a hereditary small vessel disease, which causes stroke in young adults. The genetic mutation is found on chromosome 19. Presentation can include migraine, cognitive decline, psychiatric disturbance, TIAs, and stroke, the latter usually with substantial/complete recovery after individual strokes, particularly early in the disease process. Imaging reveals subcortical lacunar infarcts and leukoencephalopathy in young adults. The frontal lobe has the highest lesion load, followed by the temporal lobe and insula. Anterior temporal pole and external capsule lesions have higher sensitivity and specificity for CADASIL. The cerebral cortex is usually spared. MRI is the investigation of choice: CT will reveal only areas of hypodensity and angiography is normal.\nSSAE is associated with hypertension and results in multiple lacunar infarcts in the lenticular nuclei, pons, internal capsule, and caudate nuclei. MELAS and MERRF are mitochondrial disorders. MELAS results in bilateral multiple cortical and subcortical hyperintense lesions on FLAIR images; MERRF has a propensity for the basal ganglia and caudate nuclei, and watershed ischaemia/ infarcts are common. Hypercoagulable states such as protein S deficiency result in cortical and lacunar infarcts of various sizes, but the cerebral angiogram is abnormal",

      response: "",
      answer: "Toxoplasmosis",
      explanation: "This is the most common intracranial opportunistic infection in AIDS patients and the most common cause of intracranial mass lesions in this population, with lymphoma second and cryptococcus third. Differentiating toxoplasmosis from lymphoma has been the subject of much debate in the literature and ultimately there is no definitive means of differentiating them on imaging alone. As described toxoplasmosis causes multiple ring-enhancing lesions and often affects the basal ganglia. Lymphoma tends to involve the subependymal regions and can cause leptomeningeal enhancement. Lymphoma can cause encasement of the ventricle, which is not seen with toxoplasmosis. Toxoplasmosis tends to be higher intensity on T2WI/FLAIR than lymphoma.\nPET and thallium SPECT have also been reported to show abnormal uptake in lymphoma, but not toxoplasmosis, although exceptions exist. Response to anti-toxoplasma treatment is often used as a clinical differentiator.\nCryptococcus classically causes dilatation of Virchow–Robin spaces.

      explanation: "The imaging findings clearly describe an extra-axial tumour. These are classed as either lesions of meningeal origin or tumours of neurogenic origin. The broad dural base and dural tail indicates that this is a tumour of meningeal origin. Meningioma is the most common of these tumours, but the imaging characteristics are not typical. World Health Organization (WHO) 1 and 2 meningiomas demonstrate uniform enhancement, although haemorrhage into meningiomas is recognized. WHO 3 meningiomas (malignant meningiomas) are indicated on imaging when there is invasion of the adjacent parenchyma, which is not described. Otherwise, the diagnosis of malignant meningioma is made by an aggressive pattern of growth on serial imaging and biopsy. The dual arterial supply is also atypical. While meningiomas can have dual supply, they more typically derive their arterial supply from the external carotid (via the meningeal artery). Melanocytomas are suggested on imaging by increased signal on T1WI and are more commonly infratentorial. Without this, the diagnosis is again reached most commonly following biopsy.

These all derive their supply from the ECA, although parafalcine meningiomas can also receive supply from a branch of the ophthalmic artery. Tentorial or cerebellopontine angle (CPA) tumours are classically fed by the Bernasconi–Casanari artery, a branch of the meningohypophyseal trunk of the ICA.

While there are many causes, pilocytic astrocytoma and medulloblastoma account for over 60% of all childhood posterior fossa masses. Pilocytic astrocytomas have a classical appearance of being cystic lesions with an avidly enhancing mural nodule. However, 30% of pilocytic astrocytomas are solid tumours. In differentiating them from medulloblastomas, pilocytic astrocytomas often arise more peripherally and displace the fourth ventricle, whereas medulloblastomas usually arise centrally from the vermis. Subarachnoid seeding is seen in up to 50% of cases of medulloblastoma. Ependymomas are also included in the differential. As these arise from the ependyma lining the ventricle, they tend to be centred on the fourth ventricle in children. Metastases are the most common cause of a posterior fossa mass in adults, but are less common in children",

However, assessment of the imaging characteristics increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The second most common cause of CPA tumour is meningioma (10%). Differentiating features are lack of a dural tail, acute angle with the petrous bone (seen in schwannomas, less commonly with meningiomas, which make an obtuse angle), and, most importantly, expansion of the internal auditory canal (IAC). Facial nerve schwannomas can appear in the same site and appear identical, but they only constitute 4% of lesions in this site and as such would not be the most likely cause.

It is important to recognize that the imaging findings describe pachymeningeal, not leptomeningeal, enhancement and as such the causes of leptomeningeal enhancement (bacterial or fungal meningitis) can be discounted. Similarly a recent stroke can cause gyriform enhancement, not pachymeningeal enhancement. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy to cause pachymeningeal enhancement, but this would usually be more nodular than smooth. CSF leak or any cause of intracranial hypotension will be associated with smooth pachymeningeal thickening, primarily over the convexities and falx. This enhances, not because of any inflammatory process, but because this part of the meninges has no blood–brain barrier, unlike the leptomeninges",

The globe is often distorted and displaced, but rarely invaded. The lesion is aggressive and there may be extension into the sinuses or intracranial compartment, and bony destruction can occur. NHL is usually found in older adults, but it can occur in older children or adolescents. Unlike rhabdomyosarcoma, NHL commonly causes lacrimal gland involvement, may be hypointense on T2WI, and encases rather than distorts the globe. Capillary haemangioma typically presents in the first few months of life. They have a proliferative phase for approximately 12 months following diagnosis and then are stable, before gradually involuting over a period of years. These lesions show rapid and persistent enhancement on CT and MRI. On unenhanced MRI, it is typically iso- to hyperintense relative to muscle on T1WI and moderately hyperintense on T2WI, with flow voids at the periphery of or within the tumour.

      answer: "Venous-lymphatic malformation",
      explanation: "Venous-lymphatic malformation (previously known as a lymphangioma) typically has a presentation in childhood. MRI is the modality of choice for diagnosis, as fluid–fluid levels are almost pathognomic of this condition and these represent areas of haemorrhage of varying ages. The MRI findings are as those described and there are typically no large feeding vessels or flow voids. The lesion is predominantly extraconal, but can insinuate into the intraconal compartment. Capillary haemangioma also presents in childhood, but may be apparent clinically and on MRI there are not typically fluid–fluid levels, but there may be flow voids within the lesion from prominent vessels. Also, enhancement is usually more rapid and persistent in capillary haemangioma than in venous-lymphatic malformation. Orbital varices usually present in young adults and on imaging have the appearance of dilated, tortuous vessels. Cavernous haemangioma typically presents in adulthood. They are usually well-circumscribed and most often occur in the lateral aspect of the retrobulbar intraconal space.

While it can also occur in meningioma, it is more common in glioma and some cases of meningioma may even have a narrowed canal secondary to bony hyperostosis.

The gray/white matter interface of the frontotemporal lobes, corpus callosum (especially the splenium), and brainstem are the most commonly involved sites in DAI. MRI is much more sensitive and is the investigation of choice.

      answer: "FLAIR",
      explanation: "Although CT is generally used for investigating acute subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), FLAIR sequence on MRI has been suggested as being as sensitive as or more sensitive than CT. It is particularly useful in regions where CT may be limited due to beam hardening artifacts or if there is a very small amount of blood. Acute SAH appears as high intensity on FLAIR within the cisterns and sulci. Subacute SAH may be better appreciated on MRI because of its high signal intensity when the blood is isointense to CSF on CT. SAH differs from intra-parenchymal hemorrhage in that the mix of blood with high-oxygen tension CSF delays generation of paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin, and oxyhemoglobin remains present longer than in intra-parenchymal hemorrhage. This contributes to continued T2 prolongation. Beware that there are other pathological (meningitis, leptomeningeal metastases, acute stroke, fat-containing tumor/dermoid rupture) and benign (artifact, supplemental oxygenation) causes of FLAIR hyperintensity in the subarachnoid space. Chronic hemorrhage from SAH is best detected on GE sequences, resulting in marked subarachnoid low signal (the blooming of superficial siderosis)",

      explanation: "Hyperintensity in the tegmentum (except for the red nucleus) and hypointensity of the superior colliculus are described as the ‘face of the giant panda sign’ and are seen in axial T2WI sections of the midbrain in Wilson’s disease. A ‘double panda sign’ has also been described, with a second ‘panda cub face’ in the pons. Abnormal signal can also be seen in the basal ganglia and thalamus in Wilson’s disease (putamen most commonly). The signal abnormalities are due to copper deposition. Signal is generally reduced on T1WI sequences, although it may be increased due to the paramagnetic effects of copper and also due to the hepatic component of Wilson’s disease (a portocaval shunt can produce this latter finding). Signal is generally increased on T2WI sequences, but it can be of mixed or reduced intensity. Similarly carbon monoxide poisoning and methanol poisoning can cause increased or reduced signal on T1WI. Methanol poisoning typically causes abnormal signal in the putamen, with haemorrhagic necrosis being more typical, whereas carbon monoxide poisoning typically affects the globus pallidus. The latter would be expected to cause low attenuation in the basal ganglia on CT. The findings on CT exclude basal ganglia hemorrhage. Amphetamine and cocaine abuse can cause high T2WI signal in the basal ganglia due to small areas of infarction, but are not associated with the midbrain changes",

      explanation: "An SDH will cross suture lines and may extend over the whole cerebral hemisphere; an EDH will not. Only an EDH can cross the midline, and this usually occurs at the vertex in the setting of a venous EDH. EDHs are more usually arterial bleeds and associated with temporal skull fractures, which disrupt the adjacent middle meningeal artery. The latter are typically biconvex; SDHs are typically lentiform in shape. Both measure 50–60 HU if acute. Chronic SDHs may be iso- or hypodense to brain, although anemia or clotting disorders can produce a similar appearance. EDH is a neurosurgical emergency more so than SDH because of the potential lucid period followed by sudden deterioration as arterial bleeding continues after having stripped the dura from the inner table of the skull",

The imaging reveals dilated ventricles with rounded frontal horns, which are enlarged out of proportion to the degree of sulcal enlargement (as one would see in cerebral atrophy). On CT there may be periventricular low attenuation in the frontal and occipital regions, representing transependymal CSF flow. The MRI equivalent is periventricular high signal and there are other MRI findings, including upward bowing of the corpus callosum and the aqueductal flow void sign (reflecting increased CSF velocity through the cerebral aqueduct). The bradykinesia and gait apraxia of NPH may mimic Parkinson’s disease, although there is typically no associated tremor.

This is a usually reversible neurological syndrome with a variety of presenting symptoms ranging from altered mental status to seizures, headache, and loss of vision. Common causes include hypertension, eclampsia and preeclampsia, immunosuppressive medications such as cyclosporine, various antineoplastic agents (including interferon), SLE, and various causes of renal failure. Hypertension is common in PRES, but may be mild and is not universally present, especially in the setting of immunosuppression. However, in the vignette given, hypertension is a possible cause and should be sought. Cyclosporin or tacrolimus might be causes; the former is thought to result in PRES both via a direct neurotoxic effect and by causing hypertension. The condition is not always reversible and may result in haemorrhagic infarcts. The classic MRI finding is of hyperintensity on FLAIR in the parieto-occipital and posterior frontal cortical and subcortical white matter.

      answer: "SLE",
      explanation: "The combination of white matter hyperintensities and focal infarcts (indicated by the areas of restricted diffusion) in combination with established neurology and neuropsychiatric symptoms, in a woman of child-bearing age, strongly suggests the diagnosis of cerebral lupus. SLE is an autoimmune disorder that affects many organ systems, including the CNS. Clinical presentation can include migraine, seizures, stroke, chorea, psychosis, mood disorder, acute confusional state, cognitive dysfunction, transverse myelopathy, cranial neuropathies, and aseptic meningitis. The CNS pathology includes vasculitis, dural venous sinus thrombosis, cerebritis, intracranial haemorrhage, infarction, and infection. Infarction can occur as a result of direct thrombosis as well as embolism from Libman–Sacks endocarditis. Diffuse neuropsychiatric symptoms are attributed to direct neuronal damage mediated by antibodies. The most common imaging finding is small multifocal T2WI or FLAIR hyperintense white matter lesions. Focal infarcts and grey matter lesions may also be seen, as well as diffuse steroid responsive subcortical lesions. Acute lesions may enhance. MR angiography and venography may show thrombotic lesions of vessels and dural venous sinus thrombosis, respectively. When a patient with SLE presents with an acute neurological deterioration, it is crucial to image them promptly: initially with unenhanced CT to exclude haemorrhage and then with MRI (including post-contrast sequences) to evaluate for stroke or abscess. Note that a negative brain MRI cannot exclude cerebral lupus. Treatment consists of immunosuppression, with anticoagulation for thrombotic events. Stroke is atypical for MS. Small vessel ischaemia should not occur in such a young age without an underlying cause and is not a satisfactory diagnosis. Susac syndrome is a triad of encephalopathy, branch retinal artery occlusions, and hearing loss. It is a microangiopathy of unknown aetiology and results in multiple T2WI hyperintense deep white matter and corpus callosum lesions. Lyme disease results in T2WI hyperintense periventricular white matter lesions, which may enhance, and it may resemble ADEM or MS",

Diffuse reduced activity of the cortical/subcortical regions and cerebellum is more typical of multiinfarct dementia.

      explanation: "T2 fast SE is probably the least useful sequence when specifically looking for vertebral marrow deposits because the metastases are less conspicuous, typically being high signal on a background of high-signal fatty marrow. On STIR and T2 fast SE with fat saturation, the metastases typically stand out as being of increased signal on a background of dark marrow because of the fat saturation techniques. On T1 fast SE sequences, the metastases typically stand out as being low signal on a background of high-signal fatty marrow. Finally, T1 GE out–of-phase imaging is also good for looking for vertebral metastatic disease. This is a sequence with a specific echo time corresponding to the time it takes for water and fat protons to move exactly 180° out of phase. In the normal adult human, the medullary bone of the vertebral bodies contains approximately equal amounts of water and fat protons. In out-of-phase conditions, the signal of both will cancel out, leaving the vertebrae completely black. In the case of vertebral pathology, however, the signal will increase and, as such, vertebral metastases (or other lesions) will clearly stand out",

      explanation: "Understanding the retropharyngeal space anatomy is crucial in differentiating retropharyngeal space abscess and retropharyngeal suppurative lymph node. The retropharyngeal space is bounded by visceral fascia covering the pharynx and oesophagus anteriorly, the prevertebral fascia covering the prevertebral muscles posteriorly, and the carotid sheaths laterally. A retropharyngeal suppurative lymph node is unilateral, whereas a retropharyngeal abscess fills the entire retropharyngeal space from side to side. The differentiation is important because many cases of suppurative lymph nodes do not have purulent material at surgery. The treatment for suppurative lymph nodes is a trial of antibiotics if the patient is stable. Surgical drainage is considered if there is progression or if the suppurative lymph node is large at presentation. The volume of central low density is a better predictor of purulence than the mere presence of rim enhancement and low-density centre",

The findings of neurosarcoid are non-specific, with the common manifestations mirroring those described in this patient. Leptomeningeal thickening and enhancement are classical. Involvement of the perivascular spaces adjacent to this can cause increased signal in the adjacent cortex. This appearance can mimic meningioma. Multifocal meningiomas and nerve sheath schwannomas are features of NF-2, but this would not be expected to resolve with steroid therapy. The features described are not typical of TS. The meningeal disease would make MS unlikely, even given the periventricular high-signal lesions, which are the most common intraparenchymal findings in neurosarcoid. Sarcoid involving the skull table is not directly related to the neurosarcoid and is more commonly seen with other manifestations of musculoskeletal sarcoid. Toxoplasmosis, in the absence of immunocompromise, is unlikely. Overall the response to steroid, along with the wide variation of CNS disease described, are the strongest indicators for sarcoid.

Most of the superior cerebrum is drained by the superior sagittal sinus. The transverse sinuses receive blood from the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. The transverse sinuses drain into the sigmoid sinuses and on into the internal jugular veins. The straight sinus forms from the confluence of the inferior sagittal sinus and vein of Galen. The vein of Galen is part of the deep venous system, which drains the corpus callosum, basal ganglia, thalami, and upper brainstem. Cavernous sinus thrombosis presents with proptosis and cranial nerve palsies (usually cranial nerve VI first). The cavernous sinus receives the petrosal sinuses and middle cerebral veins",

      explanation: "Brain AVMs are abnormal connections between arteries that would normally supply the brain tissue and veins that normally drain the brain, resulting in shunting with an intervening network of vessels within the brain parenchyma. The finding of early venous drainage is important in differentiating brain AVMs from other vascular lesions. Cortical venous drainage may be seen in superficial lesions. Recruitment of transdural supply is observed in large lesions, although this is a more typical feature of proliferative angiopathy, which is a diffuse type of AVM. Classically, in this condition, normal brain parenchyma is interspersed between the abnormal vessels. Stenoses of feeder vessels are also often identified in proliferative angiopathy. The caput medusa of dilated medullary veins is a feature of DVAs, a normal variant. Dilated cortical veins are seen in dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVFs), which are abnormal connections between arteries that normally supply the meninges (but not the brain) and small venules within the dura",

The classification relies on pathology, but as this requires brain biopsy it is not without significant risk. Advanced MRI techniques play an increasing role in helping to differentiate these lesions, as low-grade lesions may be managed via a ‘watch and wait’ approach. Conventional MRI is poorly sensitive for glioma grading, as low-grade gliomas can enhance (in up to 20%) and up to 30% of non-enhancing gliomas are malignant. MR perfusion can help differentiate, as rCBV tends to increase with tumour grade. A threshold of 1.75 is commonly utilized to separate low- from high-grade gliomas, but low-grade oligodendrogliomas can give misleadingly elevated rCBV values. The classic MR spectroscopy features of high-grade lesions are elevated choline and reduced NAA In addition, an elevated lactate signal is typical of high-grade lesions secondary to the anaerobic environment. ADC is usually lower in high-grade lesions, but there is considerable overlap and so ADC maps are insufficient on their own for predicting tumour grade",

Most vestibular schwannomas arise from the inferior vestibular nerve within the IAM and as they grow they smoothly erode the posterior edge of the porus acousticus.

Hormone production is compromised in both conditions, although a history of infertility is common with adenomas, whereas patients with AH typically achieve spontaneous pregnancy.

Features consistent with adenoma were asymmetrically enlarged pituitary, size >6 cm3 , and associated sinus mucosal thickening. The normal posterior pituitary gland is bright on T1WI due to the rich content of vasopressin neurosecretory granules. This is frequently lost in AH due to direct autoimmune involvement of the neurohypophysis, whereas it is conserved in the majority of adenomas, even when displaced by large tumour size",
