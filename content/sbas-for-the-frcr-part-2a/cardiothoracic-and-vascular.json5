      answer: "Bilateral pleural effusions",
      explanation: "The underlying diagnosis is ARDS. The causes may be direct lung injury (e.g. pneumonia, toxic gas inhalation, aspiration) or indirect lung injury (e.g. trauma, sepsis, pancreatitis). Diagnostic guidelines require a partial pressure of arterial O2/fraction of inspired O2 (PaO2/FiO2) < 200 mmHg and no evidence of left heart failure, and thus the presence of a pleural effusion casts doubt on the diagnosis; the appearance of ARDS can otherwise mimic pulmonary oedema. Bronchial dilatation is frequently seen on CT. The alveolar changes are heterogenous, showing a density gradient in both the cranio-caudal and antero-posterior directions (the dorsal/dependent and lower lobes are denser than the ventral/non-dependent and upper lobes). Radiographic changes tend to be absent for the fi rst 24 hours (with the exception of direct lung injury), then increase to remain static for days or weeks, and then begin to resolve. Pneumothorax can occur secondary to ventilation. Reticular changes, with a predilection for non-dependent lung, may be secondary to the underlying process or to barotrauma (seen in 85% of survivors in one study; the mortality of ARDS is approximately 50%)",

      explanation: "RBILD is a disease of smokers and the centrilobular nodules refl ect chronic infl ammation in the respiratory bronchioles. GGO may occur and is typically multifocal and upper lobe predominant. Reticulation is uncommon and fi brosis is not a typical feature. The typical features of UIP are reticulation, honeycombing, and traction bronchiectasis, with a basal and subpleural predominance. NSIP has overlapping features with UIP, but GGO is more common and honeycombing less common. There is a similar basal and subpleural predominance on HRCT. DIP is a rare disease and, like RBILD, associated with smoking. The cardinal feature is GGO, with a basal and peripheral predominance. Sometimes small cystic areas can be seen within the areas of GGO. Progression to fi brosis/honeycombing is rare. COP was formerly known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The main fi nding on HRCT is consolidation, which is usually multifocal and bilateral. It typically has a lower zone and peripheral predominance, but can affect any lobe. Dilated airways are often seen on HRCT with air bronchograms mimicking acute pneumonia. There may also be GGO and reticulation, but lung volumes are usually maintained",

      answer: "The abnormal bronchial artery is embolized at its origin",
      explanation: "Bronchial artery embolization (BAE) is an established procedure in the management of massive haemoptysis. Knowledge of the bronchial artery anatomy and its variations is essential in carrying out the procedure safely. A preliminary descending thoracic aortogram is performed to identify the number and site of origin of the bronchial arteries. Abnormal bronchial arteries are visualized on the preliminary thoracic aortogram in the majority of affected patients. Selective bronchial angiography is performed with manual injection of contrast. Selective bronchial artery catheterization and safe positioning distal to the origin of spinal cord branches is essential to avoid spinal cord ischaemia/infarction. Polyvinyl alcohol particles (350–500 μm diameter) are the most frequently used embolic agent. Smaller particles can freely fl ow via the intrapulmonary shunts, causing pulmonary or systemic infarcts. Chest pain is the most common complication (24–91%). Other complications include dysphagia (due to embolization of oesophageal branches), dissection of the bronchial artery or aorta (usually self-limited), and spinal cord ischaemia",

      explanation: "Tracheal malignancies make up 1–2% of all adult intrathoracic tumours and as such are uncommon. Malignant lesions make up 90% of all tracheal malignancies. Of these, squamous cell carcinomas are the most common, presenting in elderly patients with a history of smoking. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is the next most common, presenting in a younger age group and associated with a better prognosis. Benign lesions account for less than 10%. Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) would be the leading differential diagnosis if this lesion was found endobronchially, but not in the trachea. NSCLC can cause tracheal narrowing, but as an extrinsic lesion. The history is too brief for post-intubation stenosis to be considered and this is not associated with a soft tissue mass",

      explanation: "This is an infrequent complication of long bone fracture, occurring in 1–3% of patients with simple tibial or femoral fractures, but in up to 20% of those with more severe trauma. Less commonly it can be caused by major burns, pancreatitis, haemoglobinopathy, tumours and liposuction. A complication of pulmonary, cerebral, and cutaneous symptoms (petechiae secondary to coagulopathy), it typically occurs within 12–24 hours after the traumatic event. The time lapse between the traumatic event and the radiographic abnormalities is usually 1–2 days, which allows differentiation from traumatic contusion. The radiographic fi ndings resemble ARDS, although a peripheral distribution of consolidation is described. V/Q scanning will reveal multiple peripheral perfusion defects. In practice it is the clinical features such as the rash, confusion, and coagulopathy, as well as the presence of a fracture, which raise the suspicion of fat embolism",

If centrilobular nodules are present, one should think of other forms of diffuse lung disease such as respiratory bronchiolitis interstitial lung disease (RBILD) or hypersensitivity pneumonitis. If multiple cysts are present, again other diffuse lung disease should be considered, such as lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP), DIP, lymphangioleiomyomatosis, and pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Areas of air-trapping would be a more typical fi nding in hypersensitivity pneumonitis, rather than NSIP. Pleural effusions are not a typical fi nding in NSIP",

      answer: "Critical stenosis of the origin of the left subclavian artery",
      explanation: "The vertebral artery arises from the fi rst part of the subclavian artery. Stenosis/obstruction of the subclavian artery at its origin (i.e. proximal to the origin of the vertebral artery) leads to reversal of fl ow in the vertebral artery to maintain circulation to the ipsilateral upper limb. This effectively ‘steals’ blood from the posterior cerebral circulation, resulting in symptoms of vertebro-basilar insuffi ciency. Exercising the ipsilateral extremity triggers the symptoms of vertebro-basilar and/or brachial insuffi ciency. Atherosclerosis is the most common (94%) acquired cause of subclavian steal syndrome. It is more common in males and on the left side, with a ratio of 3:1. Additional lesions of extracranial arteries are often seen (up to 81%) when symptoms of vertebro-basilar insuffi ciency are present. However, the underlying pathology for this syndrome is stenosis/occlusion of the origin of the subclavian artery",

      answer: "Relapsing polychondritis",
      explanation: "Wegener’s granulomatosis and amyloidosis can both give a similar appearance to that described. Amyloid can occur as an isolated condition or as a part of systemic amyloidosis. It gives smooth narrowing, but can also give multifocal stenoses or plaques, and is frequently associated with calcifi cation. Wegener’s commonly affects the subglottic region, giving an identical appearance, although it can cause a more irregular pattern of thickening and ulcer formation. Similarly Wegener’s commonly affects the cartilage in the nose. However, histologically, Wegener’s causes vasculitis and granuloma formation. Mounier–Kuhn disease is also known as tracheobronchomegaly. It can be associated with tracheobronchomalacia, which may give a similar CT appearance to that described. The key difference is that this condition is characterized by a reduction in calibre of >50% of the airway lumen during expiration, as compared to inspiration.

This can mimic consolidation on plain fi lm, but will be seen to resolve after diuresis. Pleural effusions may be unilateral in cardiac failure",

      answer: "Perfusion defect with a rim of surrounding normally perfused lung",
      explanation: "Multiple bilateral perfusion defects with a normal ventilation scan are the classic diagnostic fi ndings in PE. Occluding pulmonary emboli produce segmental perfusion defects that extend to the pleural surface. As other conditions may also produce perfusion defects, the ventilation scan improves specifi city. Non-embolic lung disease will typically have both perfusion and ventilation abnormalities, resulting in matched defects. V/Q scans are categorized as normal, low, intermediate, or high probability. A perfusion defect that matches ventilation and CXR abnormalities in size and location is a triple matched defect. A triple matched defect in the middle or upper lung zones is in keeping with low probability, but rises to intermediate probability when in the lower zones. A single moderate matched V/Q defect, but with a normal CXR, is also of intermediate probability. No perfusion defect is in keeping with a normal scan and four moderate segmental defects is a high probability scan. A perfusion defect with a rim of surrounding normally perfused lung is known as the stripe sign and corresponds to low probability for PE, as PE perfusion defects should extend to the pleural surface and have no overlying stripe of perfused lung",

      answer: "Type V endoleak",
      explanation: "The main aim of endovascular or surgical treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is exclusion of the aneurysm sac from the systemic high-pressure circulation. Ongoing leakage of blood into the excluded aneurysm sac after endovascular repair is termed ‘endoleak’. Identifi cation of the type of endoleak and its effect on the aneurysm sac is important for further management.\n\nType I endoleak: Contrast/blood leak at the proximal or distal landing zones of the stent graft is described as type I endoleak. This is due to poor proximal or distal graft apposition, exposing the sac to systemic pressures with signifi cant risk of aneurysm rupture. This type is further sub-divided into type IA (proximal aortic attachment) and type IB (distal iliac attachment). These are most commonly seen at the time of the procedure or may develop subsequently due to graft migration. They require urgent treatment.\n\nType II endoleak: This is due to retrograde fl ow into the aneurysm sac via the inferior mesenteric artery (type IIA) or lumbar arteries (type IIB). Many of these close spontaneously and are managed expectantly. Further treatment is indicated if the sac enlarges or the patient develops symptoms of sac pressurization.\n\nType III endoleak: Leakage of blood through the body of the stent graft due to either poor apposition of graft components or a tear in the graft material is type III endoleak. This requires urgent management due to sac pressurization.\n\nType IV endoleak: Aneurysm sac opacifi cation without an identifi able source intraprocedurally is described as type IV endoleak. These are transient and usually resolve after withdrawal of anticoagulation.\n\nType V endoleak: Continued growth of the sac without radiological evidence of a leak is termed type V endoleak or endotension. Continued growth of the aneurysm sac will require surgical repair due to risk of rupture",

Overall complication rates for the two procedures are similar. The chance of tumour seeding is low and is postulated to be lower when coaxial systems are used. Air embolism is also rare, although it is more common in core biopsies and when a central lesion is being sampled. The main drawback of FNA is inadequate sampling, which frequently occurs, requiring a repeat procedure.

The most common radiographic appearance is lung nodules or irregularly marginated masses with no zonal predilection. The nodules are solitary in up to 25% and cavitating in 50% of cases. The cavities usually have a thick, irregular wall. With treatment they may resolve or result in a scar. Peripheral areas of wedge-shaped consolidation representing infarction may occur. Pleural effusions occur in less than 10% and mediastinal/hilar adenopathy is uncommon. Tracheal and bronchial thickening can be smooth or nodular. Haemorrhage can result in focal areas of dense consolidation, patchy bilateral areas of consolidation, or diffuse consolidation (these may be difficult to distinguish from infection). The main differential diagnosis would be Churg–Strauss syndrome, which involves asthma, eosinophilia (which would be noticed in the full blood picture), and less severe renal and sinus disease. Patchy transient consolidation, which may be peripheral, is the norm and nodules may occur, although cavitation is rare. Wegener’s granulomatosis is associated with c-ANCA and Churg–Strauss with p-ANCA. Goodpasture’s syndrome is associated with glomerulonephritis and pulmonary haemorrhage, but the findings are initially extensive perihilar and basal consolidation with sparing of the apices, which is subsequently replaced by an interstitial pattern. Cavitating nodules are not a feature. Haemoptysis is uncommon in sarcoidosis and cavitating nodules rare; one would typically expect perilymphatic nodules and in classic cases adenopathy. TB can produce cavitating nodules and haemoptysis, but the other features are more consistent with Wegener’s granulomatosis",

      answer: "Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension",
      explanation: "Pulmonary hypertension is the haemodynamic consequence of vascular changes within the precapillary (arterial) or postcapillary (venous) pulmonary circulation. The diagnosis of primary (idiopathic) pulmonary hypertension (PPH) can only be made after exclusion of known secondary causes. The classical findings in advanced disease include prominent central pulmonary arteries with sharply tapering peripheral vessels and right ventricular enlargement. It typically affects younger women of childbearing age. The radiographic features of pulmonary hypertension caused by chronic shunting are similar to PPH, although a normal-sized cardiac silhouette may reflect diminished shunting due to a markedly elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Most congenital cardiac lesions that may eventually cause pulmonary hypertension are now repaired at an early age. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension may mimic PPH clinically, making diagnosis difficult. Radiographic findings are more likely to be asymmetrical. A triangular opacity representing pulmonary infarction may also be seen. Schistosomiasis will demonstrate the radiographic features of pulmonary hypertension and may also exhibit tiny nodular granulomas. It is endemic in the Middle East, Africa, and the Atlantic coast of South America. Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is the post-capillary counterpart of PPH. It is suggested radiographically when the features of pulmonary arterial hypertension are accompanied by evidence of diffuse pulmonary edema and a normal-sized left atrium",

      answer: "Melanoma metastases",

The differential diagnosis given rests on the presence of this feature and cavitation. Melanoma metastases can both cavitate and produce perilesional haemorrhage. The halo sign may also be seen in other conditions with perilesional haemorrhage or cellular infiltration and is usually best seen on HRCT. These diagnoses include bronchoalveolar carcinoma, haemorrhagic metastases, Wegener’s granulomatosis, and angio-invasive infections, such as invasive aspergillosis. Alternative correct answers would be Wegener’s granulomatosis, lymphoma, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma as these can produce both cavitating nodules and the halo sign.

      answer: "Acute GI bleeding can be intermittent. Failure to demonstrate active bleeding does not prove cessation of bleeding",
      explanation: "Acute GI bleeding is a medical emergency associated with high mortality and morbidity, especially in those presenting with haemodynamic instability. The majority (75%) of GI bleeds cease spontaneously, but it can recur in 25% of cases. Accurate early diagnosis of the bleeding source is crucial. Endoscopy is commonly used to identify and treat the source of bleeding. However, it is of limited value in massive haemorrhage (due to difficulty in visualizing the bleeding point) and in assessing the distal duodenum and most of the small bowel. MDCTA is a rapid and accurate diagnostic method used to identify the site and in some cases the cause of active GI bleeding. However, acute GI bleeds (even when massive) are intermittent and failure to demonstrate active bleeding does not imply cessation of bleeding. The reported lowest detectable rate of bleeding with MDCTA, in animal and in vitro studies, is 0.35ml/min. Suture material, clips, foreign bodies, and faecoliths may lead to false–positive results. An unenhanced scan is therefore essential. A portal venous phase scan is useful in identifying venous bleeds, therefore the protocol should include unenhanced and post-intravenous contrast arterial and portal venous phase scans",

For SPNs below 1 cm in diameter, PET is less reliable due to the small volume of tissue being examined. These guidelines simply use the size of the lesion and knowledge of the patient’s relative risk (smoker versus non-smoker) to guide follow-up. Whilst Patient B’s lesion is smaller, it requires the same follow-up as the larger lesion found in Patient A because of his increased risk.

      answer: "Bronchioloalveolar carcinoma",
      explanation: "In this disease, the tumour spreads along the alveolar septa without invading alveolar walls. The air in the alveoli is replaced by tumour cells, producing consolidation and GGO. Mediastinal lymphadenopathy is rare; pleural effusion is common. Diagnosis is made by sputum/bronchial washing cytology or lung biopsy. It mimics other causes of air-space opacification such as pneumonia, haemorrhage, oedema etc. Disseminated adenocarcinoma, choriocarcinoma, or lymphoma might produce identical CT findings. PET-CT is often negative in the case of both bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and carcinoid tumours of the lung. Carcinoid is in the form of a focal mass, not diffuse consolidation. Klebsiella pneumonia classically produces enlargement of the involved lobe, bulging of the fissures with the propensity for cavitation, and abscess formation. One would expect pyrexia and raised inflammatory markers, and consolidation usually produces some abnormality on PET-CT. Small cell carcinoma is usually positive on PET-CT.

If only proximal occlusion is carried out then retrograde flow via the pancreatico-duodenal arcade will re-perfuse the pseudoaneurysm.

PET or PET-CT are better at detecting nodal disease than either CT or MRI. As such, in some cases all three modalities are necessary to stage disease. As MM does not respond well to radiotherapy or chemotherapy, the key therapeutic decision is whether or not the lesion is suitable for surgery.

      explanation: "This has been described as the radiological ‘photographic negative’ of pulmonary oedema. It is a disease of middle age and affects females more commonly than males. The history is that described, with a common history of atopy. The predominant histologic finding is filling of the alveolar airspaces with an inflammatory infiltrate containing a high proportion of eosinophils. There is usually also a cellular infiltration of the interstitium and peripheral blood eosinophilia. There is a dramatic response to steroid therapy within days. ABPA and acute eosinophilic pneumonia do produce blood eosinophilia, but the former is characterized by bronchiectasis and mucus plugging with the possibility of mosaic perfusion in addition to peripheral consolidation, while the latter is characterized by diffuse GGO, defined nodules, smooth interlobular septal thickening, and often the presence of pleural effusion. Löffler’s syndrome (simple pulmonary eosinophilia) refers to predominantly peripheral transient parenchymal consolidation accompanied by eosinophilia. There are minimal or no pulmonary symptoms, the plain film appearances change within one to several days and spontaneous resolution occurs within one month. Eosinophilic granuloma is nodular/cystic, a pulmonary form of Langerhan’s cell histiocytosis, and should not be confused with the eosinophilic pneumonias",

In this question, the lymph node is not enlarged by size criteria and is not FDG avid on PET. While this may yet still be involved, on imaging fi ndings alone, this lesion should be classed as N0.

If combined with silica dust it can cause silicosiderosis, which can be associated with fibrosis. Silicosis and coal workers pneumoconiosis, secondary to inhalation of silica dust and washed coal dust, respectively, show similar features on CT. This is usually the presence of 2–5 mm nodules, mainly involving the upper and posterior lung zones. Large opacities (>1 cm) indicate progressive massive fibrosis. Calcification in lymph nodes can occur and eggshell calcification is more typical in silicosis. Berylliosis is a chronic granulomatous lung disease caused by exposure to beryllium dust or fumes.

      answer: "Amiodarone",
      explanation: "The pulmonary findings could equally be caused by NSIP and cardiac failure, among other causes. However, the high attenuation of the liver and spleen is due to deposition of amiodarone, which contains iodine. Amiodarone, methotrexate, and bleomycin all may cause pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity occurs in 5–10% of patients on amiodarone, usually within months of starting therapy. The prognosis is good, with most patients improving after discontinuation of therapy. NSIP is the most common manifestation of amiodarone-induced lung disease. Pleural inflammation is an accompanying feature and can manifest as pleural effusion. COP is less common and typically occurs in association with NSIP. A distinctive feature of amiodarone toxicity is the occurrence of focal, homogenous pulmonary opacities. They are typically peripheral in location and of high attenuation at CT, due to the incorporation of amiodarone into the type II pneumocytes. The combination of high attenuation within the lung, liver, and spleen is characteristic of amiodarone toxicity. RA can produce many pulmonary sequelae: pulmonary nodules, pleural effusion, fibrosis, obliterative bronchiolitis, and COP. Methotrexate can be used to treat RA and psoriasis, and as chemotherapy for various cancers. NSIP is most common and COP is seen less frequently. Bleomycin is a chemotherapy agent used in the treatment of testicular carcinoma, among others. Diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) is its most common manifestation, with NSIP and COP being less common. The prognosis is poor, with most patients dying of respiratory failure within 3 months of the onset of symptoms",

      explanation: "The imaging features allude to the diagnosis of bronchial carcinoid. This tends to occur in younger patients than bronchogenic carcinoma does, and is not associated with smoking. Whilst carcinoid tumours can present as a peripheral nodule, they are more typically central, hilar, perihilar, or endobronchial, as in this case. Classical features are of a smooth nodule, narrowing or compressing the bronchus, or of an endobronchial lesion. Both commonly have stippled calcification and demonstrate avid enhancement. Carcinoid tumours in this location are classed as either typical or atypical based on pathology. All the imaging options are valid. The degree of enhancement can simulate a pulmonary vascular malformation, which can be assessed with angiography, although MR angiography would be less invasive in this case. The definitive tissue diagnosis is commonly reached with bronchoscopy, but this can be associated with massive haemorrhage because of the vascular nature of this tumour. As such radiolabelled imaging, which is sensitive in 86% of patients, is a less invasive option. FDG PET is often negative in cases of carcinoid because of the low metabolic activity of this tumour. MRI characteristics of bronchial carcinoid have been well described, but will be unlikely to significantly progress the diagnostic pathway in this case",

      answer: "Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia",
      explanation: "An area of GGO surrounded by a ring of consolidation describes the ‘ring halo’ sign. This is not specific to COP, but has been described in tuberculosis, active sarcoidosis, cryptococcosis, and blastomycosis. However it has been found that granulomatous infectious diseases and sarcoidosis, which cause the ‘ring halo’ sign, result in a nodular ring, whereas COP results in a smooth-walled ring. COP is rapidly responsive to steroids, but the latter can have deleterious effects in infectious diseases. Thus it has been suggested that a nodular ring can be used as a discriminator. COP (also known as idiopathic BOOP) is a patchy organizing pneumonia caused by bronchiolar obstruction by plugs of loose organizing connective tissue that may wax and wane. The main finding of COP is consolidation, seen in 90% and usually multifocal and bilateral. In 50% the consolidation is subpleural or peribronchovascular. It has a lower zone predominance, but can affect any lobe. Dilated airways are often seen on CT and air bronchograms give the appearance of acute pneumonia. GGO is a prominent pattern in 60%. Linear opacities occur in isolation or in association with multifocal areas of consolidation. Nodules are seen in 30–50% and lung volumes are preserved in 75%. COP is a clinical–pathological entity and is diagnosed when the correct clinical picture and radiological findings are present. If these features are uncertain, lung biopsy is required. Organizing pneumonia can be idiopathic (COP) or secondary to viral infection, toxic fume inhalation, RA, systemic lupus erythematosis (SLE), organ transplantation, drug reaction, or chronic aspiration. The hallmark of obliterative bronchiolitis is air-trapping and hyperinflation. It has many causes, including RA and other connective tissue diseases",

      answer: "Systemic amphotericin",
      explanation: "There are two parts to this question. Firstly, identifying the pathology based on imaging features. Secondly, knowledge of the treatment required. There are numerous complications that can occur post transplantation. These can be broken down into complications of the surgery, complications of monitoring, and post-operative non-surgical complications. This question obviously involves the latter group—non-surgical complications. These are largely related to immunosuppression post transplantation and include infections, rejection, accelerated atherosclerosis of the graft, and post-transplant malignancy. In the latter group, the most commonly noted malignancies are skin carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of the lung or GI tract, Kaposi sarcoma, leukaemia, and lymphoma. Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder occurs in 6%. The most common cause of death, however, is infection, particularly respiratory infection. One of the most common infections, and the infection with the highest mortality, is aspergillus infection. Invasive aspergillosis is demonstrated in this case with the hallmark features of cavitary necrosis and a surrounding halo of ground-glass change representing haemorrhage. This requires urgent antifungal therapy, but still has a mortality rate of over 50%. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis is also common, but usually displays diffuse pulmonary air-space change. This responds better to therapy, with a mortality rate of 14%. Bacterial pneumonias tend to occur earlier in the post-operative course. Acute allograft rejection gives a radiographic appearance not dissimilar to pulmonary oedema. It is usually diagnosed on endomyocardial biopsy",

      response: "",
      answer: "Myocarditis",
      explanation: "This is defined as inflammation of the heart muscle. A large variety of infections, systemic diseases, drugs, and toxins have been associated with this condition. The diagnosis is based on a combination of clinical and imaging features. The presence of focal delayed enhancement on cardiac MRI in a non-coronary artery distribution, together with wall motion abnormalities, correlates strongly with myocarditis in the correct clinical setting. Many patients present with a non-specific illness characterized by fatigue, dyspnoea, and myalgia. An antecedent viral syndrome is present in more than 50% of patients. Myocarditis lesions occur typically in the lateral free wall and originate from the epicardial quartile of the ventricular wall. The subendocardial area is spared, a pattern that is otherwise typical for myocardial infarction (in the latter case the lesion would also correspond to a coronary artery territory). In myocarditis the enhancement pattern has been described as becoming less intense and more diffuse over weeks and months. In acute myocardial sarcoidosis, increased focal signal intensity can be observed on T2WI (secondary to oedema due to inflammation) and both early and delayed post-contrast T1 weighted imaging (T1WI). Focal myocardial thickening is often seen due to the oedema and can mimic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM will reveal marked hypertrophy of the interventricular septum and left ventricular wall, with associated transmural delayed enhancement in the hypertrophied areas. The latter finding corresponds to the scattered fibrosis present and the amount of enhancement will inversely correlate with regional contractivity. Cardiac amyloidosis leads to a restrictive cardiomyopathy. MR imaging shows functional impairment, biventricular hypertrophy, and non-specific inhomogeneous gadolinium enhancement",

Radiological findings in four or more lung zones distributed bilaterally and peripherally, are significantly more often seen on the CXR obtained at admission in patients with poor outcome (requiring mechanical ventilation) compared to those with good clinical outcome. Central GGO is the most common radiographic abnormality, but is not significantly associated with poor outcome.

      answer: "Decreased calibre of vessels in lucent areas",
      explanation: "When mosaic lung attenuation is observed, it often is in an extensive, but patchy, distribution and it is important to determine if it is the lucent or denser areas of lung that are abnormal. If the blood vessels in the lucent areas are smaller, then the lucent areas are probably abnormal. The paucity of vessels in these regions may be secondary to focal air-trapping or poor ventilation and subsequent reflex vasoconstriction. If areas of lucency are exaggerated on expiratory scans (air-trapping), then this is the hallmark of small airways disease. Alternatively, if the areas of lucency do not become more prominent on the expiratory scans, small airways disease is not the likely cause. In this situation, the inhomogeneous lung attenuation is probably secondary to changes in vessel calibre, and secondary to pulmonary hypertension, including chronic PE, emphysema, or inflammatory vasculopathies. If the blood vessels in the regions of relative lucency are equal in size to vessels in surrounding areas, the regions of relative opacity are most likely abnormal, e.g. areas of GGO",

The presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, invasion of the great vessels, or distant metastases are uncommon for atypical thymoma, but are features of the other three tumours; none of these were present in this case.

It has a variety of clinical presentations, including mechanical dysfunctions and ventricular arrhythmia, and is a cause of sudden cardiac death in young adults. Pathogenesis is not yet understood. Diagnosis is based on structural, histologic, electrocardiographic, and genetic factors. There are major and minor criteria for diagnosis. Angiography and echocardiography lack sensitivity and specificity. MRI provides the most important morphological, anatomic, and functional criteria for the diagnosis of ARVD with one investigation. Findings can include fatty or fibro-fatty replacement of the right ventricular free wall myocardium (hence the high T1WI signal), dilatation of the right ventricle or right ventricular outflow tract, right ventricular aneurysms, and segmental hypokinesia. Positive MRI findings should be used as important additional criteria in the diagnosis of ARVD, but the absence of MRI findings does not exclude the diagnosis. Uhl’s anomaly is very rare (less than 100 reported cases in the 20th century) and consists of a paper-thin right ventricle, with complete absence of any musculature. It can be distinguished from ARVD as it has no gender predisposition or familial occurrence (ARVD is more common in males). Tricuspid stenosis produces dilatation of the right atrium. A pericardial effusion will result in high T2WI and low T1WI signal (unless the effusion is proteinaceous) within the pericardium. Melanoma metastases may well be high signal on T1WI, but they are rare to the heart and would not be expected to cause myocardial thinning",

      answer: "Lifestyle and risk factor modification",
      explanation: "A stenosis is suitable for PCI when it is greater than 75% and may be suitable when it lies between 50 and 75%, depending on the minimal luminal area (MLA) and functional significance. Those stenoses less than 50% are not generally suitable for intervention and require medical management only (however, the minimal luminal area of the LMS and proximal main vessels are also taken into account by some authors). Unfortunately the blooming artefact caused by calcium will cause overestimation of the size of a calcified plaque on CT coronary angiography and this remains a great limitation of the technique. In some cases this will make a vessel appear completely occluded by calcium when it is not and an alternative investigation, e.g. catheter angiography, is required. In this question, the calcified plaque will appear to cause a 50% stenosis, when in fact the stenosis is much smaller, certainly less than 50%. The LAD stenosis is too small to require treatment (assuming the vessel is of adequate size). Exercise stress testing is not of any particular use, as we have shown no need for revascularization and it would not alter management, which should be aggressive treatment of hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and lifestyle modification",

Whilst the history of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) would raise the possibility of this lesion being a neurofibroma, the CT findings of a cyst discount this. Extramedullary hematopoiesis is a rare feature of myelofibrosis and commonly gives bilateral soft tissue masses. Lateral meningoceles are herniations of CSF through a dilated neural foramen, most commonly in patients with a history of NF-1. As they contain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), the attenuation value would be comparable to water. A neuro-enteric cyst can have a similar appearance.

      answer: "Semi-invasive aspergillosis",
      explanation: "This is also known as chronic necrotising aspergillosis and typically runs a more indolent, but slowly progressive, course than angio-invasive aspergillosis and occurs in patients with mildly impaired immunity (e.g. chronic alcoholism). The radiographic findings consist of upper lobe consolidation, multiple nodules, and cavitatory disease. The gold standard for diagnosis of semi-invasive aspergillosis is the histological demonstration of tissue invasion by the fungus and growth of aspergillus on culture. However, in practice this is difficult to achieve and therefore the combination of the characteristic clinical and radiological features and either positive serological results for aspergillus or the isolation of aspergillus from respiratory samples is highly indicative of semi-invasive aspergillosis. Angio-invasive aspergillosis occurs in more severely immuno-compromised patients (e.g. AIDS patients). Rapidly progressive nodular opacities occur to form single or multiple homogeneous consolidations. The lesions show a characteristic halo sign on CT, reflecting an area of alveolar haemorrhage around a central nodule. ABPA is a hypersensitivity reaction to aspergillus fumigatus that occurs in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. It is characterized by inspissated mucus plugs containing aspergillus organisms and eosinophils, resulting in chronic inflammation in the airway and bronchial ectasia. The most common CT finding is central bronchiectasis with upper lobe predominance and mucus impaction. Aspergilloma is a mycetoma (fungus ball), which typically occurs in ectatic airways or parenchymal cavities (e.g. old TB, chronic sarcoid). CT characteristically shows an intracavitatory mass with a surrounding air crescent, more commonly in the upper lobes",

      answer: "Critical limb ischaemia",
      explanation: "Muscle pain or discomfort in the lower limb brought on by exercise and relieved by rest within 10 minutes is termed intermittent claudication. This is secondary to reduced perfusion, which may be enough during periods of rest, but on exercise is insufficient to meet the metabolic demand of the muscles. With progression of disease, these symptoms may be noticed at rest. Typical ischaemic rest pain is relieved by dependency of the foot secondary to gravity-aided blood flow. Critical limb ischaemia is the presence of rest pain or tissue loss with ulcers or gangrene. This should be distinguished from acute limb ischaemia. The term ‘critical limb ischaemia’ implies chronicity with symptoms being present for at least 2 weeks. Diabetic neuropathy is associated with burning or shooting pain in the feet, which may sometimes be difficult to differentiate from atypical ischaemic rest pain. Distinguishing features include bilateral symmetric distribution, cutaneous hypersensitivity, and failure to relieve by dependency of the foot. Reduced vibration sensation and reflexes are also seen in diabetic neuropathy. Nerve root compression may sometimes result in continuous pain but it has a dermatomal distribution and is associated with backache",

      answer: "The RCA arises from the left coronary sinus and passes between the aorta and pulmonary artery",
      explanation: "Coronary artery anomalies are rare, but can be a cause of chest pain and sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis can be difficult via conventional catheter angiography due to both difficulty in locating the abnormal ostia and correct interpretation of the vessel course. Cardiac CT is superior in this regard. The anomalies can be malignant or non-malignant depending on the site of origin and course. Option D gives the normal path of the RCA and option E is a common normal variant of the LMS; a bifurcation into LAD and LCx being more usual. In option A the RCA has an anomalous origin from the left coronary cusp and takes a malignant, ‘interarterial’ course, passing between the aorta and pulmonary artery. It is thought that when dilatation of the aorta occurs during exercise, the abnormal slit-like ostium of the RCA becomes narrower, reducing RCA perfusion and causing myocardial infarction. This variant can be associated with sudden cardiac death in 30% of patients. In option C the LMS has an anomalous origin and path, but it is benign as it passes anterior to the pulmonary artery. The multiple ostia in option B are benign and may be beneficial, as disease in one vessel proximally would not compromise the other, as would normally occur in LMS disease. A further malignant coronary anomaly is anomalous origin of the coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA), which is usually symptomatic in childhood. Myocardial bridging, in which a length of coronary artery (usually mid LAD) takes an intramyocardial course and may cause ischaemia, infarction, arrhythmia, and even death, commonly causes no symptoms",

      answer: "An enlarged aorta bulges into the inferior aspect of the retro-tracheal space",
      explanation: "Whilst lateral CXRs are seldom requested, when they are requested it is often the retro-tracheal space that requires assessment and thus knowledge of its borders and pathological conditions is relevant. The retro-tracheal space is bounded anteriorly by the posterior border of the trachea and posteriorly by the vertebrae. The inferior margin is the aortic arch. The space is of low density, being created by the lung posterior to the trachea. The posterior tracheal line is usually 2.5 mm thick, but can be 5.5 mm thick if the anterior wall of the oesophagus lies adjacent to the posterior wall of the trachea (the tracheo-oesophageal line (TOL)). Thus an enlarged aorta would be noted inferiorly. Extension of retro-pharyngeal abscesses usually occurs along the prevertebral space, posteriorly in the retro-tracheal space, thus not affecting the TOL. A normal retro-sternal goitre extending anterior to the trachea is not located in the retro-tracheal space.

Medulloblastoma is a relatively less common manifestation. The imaging characteristics of cardiac fibromas reflect their fibrous nature: low signal on T1WI and T2WI with delayed enhancement on MRI. Most are well circumscribed with a surrounding rim of compressed myocardium. On CT they manifest as mildly enhancing soft tissue attenuation masses. Foci of calcification are present in up to 50% of cases. Although benign they may cause ventricular arrhythmias and even sudden death secondary to interference with conduction pathways. Atrial myxomas are of mixed signal on T1WI and T2WI sequences. They are most commonly found within the left atrium (80%), with 15% in the right atrium. On CT a low attenuation intracavitary mass with a smooth or slightly villous surface is seen. Cardiac paragangliomas are well encapsulated, hypervascular (intensely enhancing), and 3–8cm in size.

      answer: "None of the above",
      explanation: "The presence of cardiac pacemakers used to be an absolute contraindication to MRI scanning. However, with the introduction of MR-conditional pacemakers, scanning is safe under certain conditions. Among these conditions is that only a 1.5 T (Tesla) magnet can be used, and that the appropriate pacing leads for the MRI-conditional pacemaker must be in situ. The pacemaker and leads even have a distinctive ‘wiggly’ line which is projected on chest radiographs and can be used for their recognition. Modern loop recorders are MRI compatible, although they should be interrogated in advance of the scan or information may potentially be lost. Modern metallic grafts, stents etc. are non-ferromagnetic and are generally regarded as having undergone adequate fibrosis/neo-intimal hyperplasia to become fixed within the body 6 weeks after the date of insertion. MRI is generally contraindicated in cases of cochlear implants (although there may be exceptions where the internal magnet has been surgically removed or is easily removed, or at field strengths of 0.2 T). The compatibility of any device can be verified by consulting www.mrisafety.com, but it is another matter whether the presence of a compatible device will still result in such artifact as to render the images non-diagnostic",

      answer: "Venous ultrasound",
      explanation: "For pregnant patients, venous ultrasound is recommended before imaging tests with ionizing radiation are performed. Up to 29% of pregnant patients with PE will have a positive venous ultrasound, obviating the need for further imaging. The majority of the PIOPED II investigators currently recommend V/Q scanning over CTPA in the evaluation of PE in pregnant patients. The foetal dose with V/Q is similar to that with CTPA, although the effective dose per breast is much greater with CTPA. MRI requires further evaluation and gadolinium-based contrast agents have not been proven to be safe in pregnancy. The role of catheter angiography is probably limited to those patients requiring mechanical thrombectomy. It should be noted that even a combination of CXR, lung scintigraphy, CTPA, and pulmonary angiography exposes the foetus to approximately 1.5mGy of radiation, which is well below the accepted limit of 50 mGy for the induction of deterministic effects in the foetus",
