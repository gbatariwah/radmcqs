Standard treatment with bronchodilators and inhaled steroid for presumed asthma has been unsuccessful. The CXR is abnormal, showing mild increased airspace density. The HRCT shows a bilateral pattern of ground-glass change. The interlobular septa are markedly thickened, giving a ‘crazy paving’ pattern. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

      response: "",
      answer: "Alveolar proteinosis",
      explanation: "Interstitial lung disease in children is uncommon, but it is important to be aware of as 50% of children present with a history of wheeze. Chronic idiopathic pulmonary haemosiderosis does not cause a ‘crazy paving’ pattern. It is a rare disorder (although common in exams) and when present in children usually presents before 3 years of age. Whilst a ‘crazy paving’ pattern was originally described as being typical of alveolar proteinosis, it has since been described in numerous conditions and as such a knowledge of these processes is necessary to differentiate them. Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia would not normally be considered in the absence of a history of immunocompromise. Whilst NSIP can cause this appearance, in children it more typically has an upper zone and peripheral predominance with associated ground-glass changes and a degree of honeycombing. The imaging characteristics of NSIP, LIP and DIP overlap in children and often require lung biopsy to differentiate them. LIP is also usually associated with immunodeficiency disorders, as in adults. Sarcoidosis in children is very rare and usually presents in older children, around 13–15 years of age",

      answer: "Periventricular leucomalacia",
      explanation: "This refers to white matter necrosis, typically involving the centrum semiovale, and is seen in premature infants. This results from hypoxic-ischaemic injury at the watershed areas, which in premature infants are present in a periventricular location. Porencephaly refers to an area of encephalomalacia, which may or may not communicate with the ventricular system and develops postnatally or in the third trimester. This is the end result of a destructive process, such as an intraparenchymal haemorrhage. Sylvian fissure cysts are the most common site for supratentorial arachnoid cysts. Vein of Galen malformations occur in the midline and exhibit Doppler flow. Subependymal cysts are detected in the caudothalamic groove",

      explanation: "The clue here is the café-au-lait spots, which are seen in McCune–Albright syndrome (unilateral polyostotic fibrous dysplasia, precocious puberty, and café-au-lait spots). Osteomyelitis is unlikely because of the normal inflammatory markers, lack of systemic symptoms, and lack of periosteal reaction. Aneurysmal bone cyst and GCTs are possibilities (the former may even complicate fibrous dysplasia). Chondroblastoma is an epiphyseal lesion",

      answer: "Severe renal compromise is the immediate cause of death in the perinatal group",
      explanation: "The incidence of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is approximately 1:20,000 births. It is a disease of tubular ectasia and fibrosis that results in bilateral enlarged kidneys, with loss of cortico-medullary differentiation and multiple small radially arranged cysts. ARPKD is associated with congenital hepatic fibrosis, the severity of which is inversely proportional to the renal abnormality. Four distinct groups of ARPKD are recognized based on age at presentation: perinatal, neonatal, infantile, and juvenile. The most severe renal involvement is seen in the perinatal group. In this group, severe renal impairment results in reduced urine output, oligohydramnios, and pulmonary hypoplasia. Severe respiratory compromise is the immediate cause of death in these patients. Oligohydramnios is also associated with Potter facies (low set and flattened ears, short and snubbed nose, deep eye creases, and micrognathia) and clubfoot deformity",

It may be a solitary mass or multifocal, and most are diagnosed before the age of 1 year. The lesion itself runs a benign course, but life-threatening clinical complications may occur. These include high-output cardiac failure secondary to large arterio-venous shunts and Kasabach–Merritt syndrome of coagulopathy secondary to intratumoral platelet sequestration. On ultrasound the lesions are well-demarcated and are generally hypoechoic or of mixed echogenicity. On CT and MRI the enhancement pattern of the lesion is similar to adult haemangioma.

      answer: "Pulmonary valve function",
      explanation: "As a general rule, pre-operative imaging of paediatric cardiac malformations focuses on the morphology, to allow accurate characterization of the abnormality pre-operatively. Post-operative imaging focuses more on function, to assess the success of the treatment given and need for further intervention. With regard to a corrected tetralogy of Fallot, the situs will be known and the ventricular septum assessed and usually repaired at surgery. A graft between the systemic venous system and pulmonary artery is a feature of a Fontan/Glenn procedure and these are most commonly carried out for tricuspid atresia, not tetralogy of Fallot. Assessment of the pulmonary valve, along with right ventricular function, is essential in this post-operative patient, as re-stenosis of the pulmonary valve or progressive right ventricular impairment are associated with increased morbidity",

      response: "",
      answer: "Arrange MRI, CT chest, and IBS",
      explanation: "The lesion described is probably an osteosarcoma. Ewing’s sarcoma is high on the differential diagnosis, but is less often found in the metaphysis and usually has a soft-tissue component. Osteosarcomas commonly arise from the metaphysis (only 2–11% arise from the diaphysis). They are most common in the distal femur followed by the proximal tibia. If osteoid matrix is present on plain film, osteosarcoma is the diagnosis until proven otherwise. The appropriate action would be to refer to a regional orthopaedic centre for discussion at a multidisciplinary meeting with imaging followed by biopsy or surgery as thought appropriate. An MRI is used to evaluate local extent, the CT chest and IBS to search for pulmonary and bony metastases, respectively. Surgery is often performed after repeat imaging following the administration of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, when the oedema surrounding the tumour is less pronounced. The findings are not particularly suspicious for NAI (option A). It is not safe to assume the appearances are caused by osteomyelitis and in any case more urgent investigation would be required to confirm such a diagnosis. A CT of the area might be useful but involves ionizing radiation, which MRI avoids; the MIBG scan would be appropriate for neuroblastoma, which is unlikely in this age group (90% occur before the age of 5) (option C). A metastasis is very unlikely in this age group",

      ],
      response: "",
      answer: "The upper moiety ureter is associated with ureterocele whereas the lower moiety ureter is associated with vesicoureteric reflux",
      explanation: "Ectopic ureter results when the ureteral bud fails to separate from the Wolffian duct and as a consequence is carried more caudally than normal. In females, the ectopic ureter can insert distal to the external sphincter, resulting in incontinence. Approximately 70% of ectopic insertion is associated with complete ureteral duplication. According to the Weigert–Meyer rule of complete ureteral duplication, the ureteric orifice of the upper moiety inserts into the bladder medial and inferior to the lower moiety. The ureter draining the Upper moiety is associated with Ureterocele and Obstruction (note the vowels), whereas the lower pole moiety is associated with vesico-ureteric reflux. The obstructed upper moiety may not be visualized on IVU. The absence of upper pole calyx and displaced (‘drooping lily’) lower moiety calyces help in making the diagnosis",

Although it is usually asymptomatic and an incidental finding, it can lead to recurrent episodes of pancreatitis in children and adults. By definition, the dorsal and ventral ducts fail to fuse during embryological development, which results in the following features seen at MRCP: (a) a prominent dorsal pancreatic duct, which drains directly into the minor papilla, and (b) a ventral duct, which does not communicate with the dorsal duct, but joins with the distal bile duct to enter the major papilla (ampulla of Vater).

Whilst placement inferior to this may be satisfactory, it can result in placement within the right atrium or coronary sinus, which are associated with an increased risk of complications. When assessing the ET tube in neonates, the tip should lie between the carina and the thoracic inlet, as more accurate placement is difficult given the size of the patient. UACs are divided into high and low lines. High lines should have their tip between T8 and T10. Low lines should be sited below L3.

Inter-hemispheric subdural haematoma has the highest specificity of abuse for any intracranial injury. Subarachnoid haemorrhage is also a much more common injury in NAI.

      answer: "Duodenal web",
      explanation: "A duodenal web is classically associated with the ‘windsock sign’ seen on an upper GI contrast study. Over time, the web or diaphragm passively elongates as a result of continual peristalsis, to form the windsock configuration of an intraluminal duodenal diverticulum. Duodenal atresia is commonly associated with the ‘double bubble’ appearance on AXR. The atresia is most commonly just distal to the ampulla of Vater. Associated anomalies are common, such as congenital heart disease, Down’s syndrome, and malrotation. Midgut volvulus is usually a complication of malrotation. The AXR may be normal, gasless, or show signs of duodenal/high small bowel obstruction. The upper GI contrast study shows an abnormal position of the duodenal-jejunal flexure (to the right of midline) or duodenal obstruction in severe cases. More often the volvulus is intermittent, when the ‘corkscrew’ appearance is classical, due to clockwise twisting of the jejunum around the superior mesenteric artery. Annular pancreas and preduodenal portal vein are exceedingly rare. In preduodenal portal vein (persistent left vitelline vein), the portal vein lies in an abnormal position anterior to the duodenum and may cause compression. However, in this entity, the primary obstruction is more usually due to an associated obstructing duodenal lesion, such as an intraluminal membrane or web, and not to the abnormal position of the vein",

Transient tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN) and meconium aspiration syndrome also classically cause increased lung volumes and streaky perihilar density, although the radiographic appearance of meconium aspiration can also often be difficult to differentiate from beta-haemolytic streptococcal pneumonia. A useful differentiation is that pleural effusions are uncommon in meconium aspiration, but are commonly seen in beta-haemolytic streptococcal pneumonia. TTN is also characterized by rapid clearance and would not be expected to persist on serial radiographs.

      answer: "An atlanto-dens interval (ADI) of 6 mm",
      explanation: "There are appearances that are normal for a paediatric cervical spine, which would be considered pathological in an adult and of which it is important to be aware. Pseudo-subluxation at C2/3 and C3/4 is common (it was observed in 46% of patients less than 8 years old at C2/3 in one study and has been seen up to 14 years). The anterior aspects of the spinous processes of C1, C2, and C3 should line up within 1 mm of each other on flexion and extension (assessed by drawing the posterior cervical line, a line from the anterior aspect of the spinous process of C1 to the equivalent point at C3). The anterior aspect of the spinous process of C2 is allowed to pass through, touch, or lie up to 1 mm behind the posterior cervical line in physiological subluxation. The normal ADI (the distance between the anterior aspect of the dens and the posterior aspect of the ring of the atlas) in adults is 3 mm, but is normal up to 5 mm in children. ‘Pseudo-Jefferson’ fractures (pseudospread of the lateral masses of C1 on C2) can be seen on the peg view, and up to 6 mm of displacement is common up to 4 years old and may be seen in patients up to 7 years old. Anterior wedging of up to 3 mm of the vertebral bodies should not be confused with compression fracture. This finding can be profound at C3. Prevertebral swelling of 6 mm or less is considered normal at C3. Widening of prevertebral soft tissues in children can be due to expiration, and if suspected, a repeat lateral film in inspiration and mild extension should be performed",

      answer: "Neonatal hepatitis",
      explanation: "Physiological jaundice of the newborn usually resolves within 2 weeks and thus is unlikely to be the cause in this case. It is also unconjugated, as is jaundice secondary to hypothyroidism. Caroli’s disease (type V of the Todani choledochal cyst classification) would typically have an abnormal ultrasound, demonstrating cystic dilatation of the intrahepatic bile ducts. The key distinction in this question is between biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis. The question stated that the ultrasound was normal and visualization of a normal-sized gallbladder has been said to favour neonatal hepatitis. However, 20% of patients with biliary atresia may have a normal-sized gallbladder, which also empties after a feed. Despite this, in the presence of a suggestive clinical picture, an absent or small gallbladder in the fasting state, a gallbladder with irregular and echogenic walls, or a large gallbladder that does not empty post feed are highly suggestive of biliary atresia. Distinction can be clarified with a HIDA scan. In early biliary atresia prior to cirrhosis, there is rapid extraction of radionuclide from the bloodstream, which persists and accumulates in the hepatic parenchyma with failure of excretion into the gut. Thus, visualization of isotope activity within the gut excludes the diagnosis of biliary atresia. In severe or late biliary atresia, hepatocyte function eventually deteriorates, resulting in sluggish tracer uptake by the hepatocytes. Patients with neonatal hepatitis often have decreased parenchymal extraction and clearance of radioisotope from the bloodstream but tracer does reach the intestines",

In this case the two likeliest conditions are BPD and PIE, both most commonly associated with immature lungs and both of which give bubbly lucencies on radiography. PIE is a feature of air leak phenomena which occur in stiff lungs and is due to either high airway pressure or alveolar overdistention causing passage of gas into the interstitial spaces. It is associated with other air leak phenomena such as pneumopericardium. BPD was originally described to occur in four stages, but the advent of refined ventilation, surfactant, and prophylactic administration of corticosteroids, have changed the typical progression.

      explanation: "The most common location for duplication cysts is in the terminal ileum. This is followed by oesophagus, duodenum, and stomach. Duplication cysts contain both mucosal and muscle layers. On ultrasound, the mucosa is represented by an inner echogenic line and the muscle as an outer hypoechoic layer. The cyst is usually anechoic, unless complicated by haemorrhage or infection. Lymphangiomas, mesenteric, and omental cysts are rare. On ultrasound, they are usually anechoic, unless complicated by debris, haemorrhage, or infection. The wall is usually thin and does not have the double layer associated with duplication cysts. Ovarian cysts arise from the pelvis and will not have the layered wall appearance of a duplication cyst",

      answer: "Congenital lobar emphysema",
      explanation: "This has a lobar predilection with around 40% being found in the left upper lobe. Congenital lobar emphysema initially presents as an area of soft tissue density due to retained foetal pulmonary fluid. This resolves and is replaced by hyperlucency. Most present in the neonatal period with respiratory distress, but they can present later. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformations (CCAM) do not show a lobar predilection, but can be found anywhere. They can be either air or fluid filled and consist of multiple cysts. CCAM are graded on the size of the cysts with type 1 lesions containing one or more large cysts, type 2 have numerous small cysts, and type 3 contain microscopic cysts, but appear solid at imaging. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias are also initially solid on plain radiography and only contain air if there is bowel present within the hernia and this contains air. This would obviously have continuity with the diaphragm and not be contained entirely within the upper lobe. Persistent PIE occurs when PIE fails to resolve after 1 week. As PIE is almost always seen in infants with surfactant deficiency being ventilated, it would not be in the differential in this case. Sequestrations are usually solid masses on plain film radiography, unless there has been a history of infection within the sequestration",

      response: "",
      answer: "Meconium plug syndrome",
      explanation: "This is a transient disorder of the neonatal colon characterized by delayed passage of meconium and proximal dilatation of the bowel. The obstruction is due to a colonic dysmotility and associated with a large meconium plug in the left colon. The colon may appear normal or distended proximal to the plug and small caliber distally. A water-soluble contrast enema is both diagnostic and therapeutic. If there is persistence of abdominal distension and/or failure to evacuate, then rectal biopsy may be needed to exclude Hirschsprung’s disease. Hirschsprung’s disease is a disorder of the bowel resulting from absence of normal ganglionic cells in the Auerbach’s and Meissner’s plexuses. Aganglionosis always affects the rectum and extends proximally for a variable distance. Short segment disease occurs in the vast majority of cases, with the transition zone (the junction between the normal-sized distal aganglionic segment and the proximal dilated bowel) occurring in the region of the rectosigmoid. Contrast enema is used to delineate the level of the transition zone and care must be taken not to overfill the recto-sigmoid and thus mask the transition zone. Irregular, uncoordinated contractions in the aganglionic segment would more commonly be seen in the distal colon in Hirschsprung’s disease than in a meconium plug syndrome. Meconium ileus syndrome is a distal small bowel obstruction secondary to thick inspissated meconium in the ileum, usually associated with CF. Water-soluble contrast enema may be both diagnostic and therapeutic. A small left colon syndrome is a subtype of meconium plug syndrome. Contrast enema shows an apparent transition zone at the splenic flexure. There is a normal-sized sigmoid colon, but a small descending colon, mimicking a microcolon, which becomes normal sized again around the splenic flexure. The caliber abnormality is therefore limited to the descending colon, which was not described in this case. Colonic atresia is secondary to a vascular insult in utero and is extremely uncommon. A microcolon exists distal to the atretic segment",

      answer: "Extralobar sequestration",
      explanation: "Sequestrations are defined as lung tissue masses with no normal connection to the bronchial tree or pulmonary arteries. This diagnosis can often be difficult to make as extralobar sequestrations are associated with CCAM and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The fact that the lesion is contained entirely within the thorax, with no abdominal connection described, means CDH is less likely. CCAM usually derive their blood supply from the pulmonary arteries. Foregut duplication cysts would be expected to be hypoechoic on ultrasound and non-vascular. The differentiation between intralobar and extralobar sequestrations is more difficult. Previously the venous drainage has been used, with intralobar described as draining to the pulmonary veins and extralobar to systemic veins (IVC or azygous commonly). In actuality, the drainage is variable and the pleural covering the only constant difference, with intralobar having a separate visceral pleural covering, but extralobar having completely separate pleura. Extralobar sequestrations are more common in males and are usually in the left hemithorax (90%).

      answer: "Loss of overlap between the medial femoral metaphysis and acetabulum",
      explanation: "Perthes’ disease and SUFE, along with transient synovitis and septic arthritis, are important paediatric causes of hip pain. The diagnosis of Perthes’ disease and SUFE is usually made initially on plain film and it is important to be able to both pick up the abnormalities and to correctly attribute them to the correct disease process (Table 5.2). The answer to question 42 is widening of the joint space. This occurs early in Perthes’ disease. There is widening of the physis initially in SUFE (in advanced slip the physis can appear narrowed), but loss of joint space rather than widening may occur late in the disease, secondary to chondrolysis. In question 42, answers A, C, and D are also features of SUFE. The line of Klein is the line along the lateral aspect of the proximal femoral metaphysis, which should normally intersect the proximal femoral epiphysis, but does not in SUFE. The answer to question 43 is loss of overlap between the medial femoral metaphysis and acetabulum. This has been termed the ‘metaphyseal extrusion’ sign and is a subtle early finding in SUFE. Answers A, D, and E are signs of Perthes’ disease, although apparent reduction in size of the femoral epiphysis can occur later in SUFE as the epiphysis slips more posteriorly. Demineralization is not a good discriminating factor. It is more associated with Perthes’ disease; it can occur in SUFE, but sclerosis of the proximal metaphysis occurs later (metaphyseal blanch sign).

The imaging features are as described. Calcification is seen in approximately 50%. HCC is the next most common malignant liver tumour and has two peaks in childhood, at 2–4 years and 12–14 years. Serum alphafetoprotein is also elevated in approximately 80%. Imaging features are similar to those seen in an adult population, i.e. larger tumours are of heterogeneous echogenicity on ultrasound and on biphasic CT they show arterial enhancement with rapid washout on the portal venous phase. Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma (UES) is the third most common liver malignancy and is most common between the ages of 6 and 10 years. Serum alphafetoprotein levels are normal. The imaging hallmark of this tumour is the discrepancy between its appearance on ultrasound and that on CT. Ultrasound is used to confirm the solid nature of this tumour, which typically is isoechoic or hyperechoic. On CT, UES is seen as a well-circumscribed, multiseptate, fluid-attenuating lesion. Enhancement of solid-appearing septa and a pseudocapsule may be seen. Mesenchymal hamartoma is the second most common benign hepatic lesion (to haemangioendothelioma). It is usually seen under the age of 2 years. Serum alphafetoprotein is not elevated. The typical ultrasound appearance is a multiseptate, cystic mass. Less commonly, the solid component of the lesion can be more predominant, with multiple smaller cysts giving the lesion a Swiss-cheese appearance. The usual CT finding is of a multilocular cystic mass with enhancing septa of varying thickness.

      explanation: "Testicular torsion is an emergency. If it is not corrected within 6 hours, testicular salvage is less likely. Torsion results initially in venous obstruction followed by arterial obstruction. The severity of testicular ischemia depends on the duration and the degree of torsion (180–720°). Clinical differentiation between testicular torsion and epididymo-orchitis can be challenging. Two types are described: intravaginal and extravaginal. ‘Bell clapper’ deformity is the term used to describe high attachment of the tunica vaginalis to the spermatic cord that leaves the testis free to rotate. On ultrasound, the affected testis may have normal echogenicity in the early phase. In the later phase, the testis enlarges and demonstrates increased or heterogenous echogenicity.

      answer: "Osteochondritis dissecans",
      explanation: "This disease is thought to represent a fracture secondary to avascular necrosis of an area of subchondral bone and cartilage, and peak incidence is at 12–13 years of age. Repetitive trauma, ischaemia, and familial tendency are common predisposing factors. In the knee, 75% of cases involve the postero-Lateral Aspect of the MEdial femoral condyle, hence the mnemonic LAME. The disease is bilateral in one-third of patients. A purely cartilaginous fragment will go unrecognized on plain film; a bony fragment and its donor site will not. Instability on MRI is suggested by fragments >1 cm, cysts larger than 5 mm within the donor site, high T2WI signal between the donor site and fragment (even if the cartilage is intact), and loose bodies within the joint.\nDistal femoral cortical irregularity (also referred to as cortical desmoid) is seen as a defect in the posterior aspect of the medial cortex of the distal femoral metaphysis, 1–2 cm proximal to the physis (at the attachment of adductor magnus). It appears low signal on T1WI and high signal on T2WI sequences. Plain film may show an ill-defined or scalloped appearance and may occasionally mimic an aggressive lesion (it is benign).\nSinding–Larsen–Johanssen disease represents osteochondrosis at the site of attachment of the patellar tendon to the patella (inferior pole). Osgood–Schlatter disease represents apophysitis at the site of attachment of the patellar tendon to the tibia, namely the anterior tibial tubercle. Both are causes of knee pain and are associated with activity and repetitive traction microtrauma.\nAn avulsion of the anterior tibial spine is the paediatric equivalent of an ACL tear (the chondroosseous tibial spine is the weakest part of the ACL complex prior to physeal closure). MRI reveals a low signal T1WI line through the anterior tibial spine",

      answer: "The pudendal nerve and internal pudendal vessels pass through the lesser sciatic foramen",

It is important to identify extrapelvic spread, as combined trans-abdominal and trans-gluteal surgery may be required. Knowledge of gluteal anatomy is also essential for trans-gluteal biopsy and drainages.\nThe greater and lesser sciatic notches are noted in the posterior border of the innominate bone separated by the ischial spine.\nThe greater sciatic foramen (GSF) is bounded antero-superiorly by the greater sciatic notch, postero-superiorly by the sacrum, and inferiorly by the sacrospinous ligament. The piriformis muscle arises from the ventral aspect of the sacrum and passes through the GSF to insert into the greater trochanter. It divides the GSF into two compartments. The suprapiriformis foramen transmits the superior gluteal vessels and nerves. The infrapiriformis foramen transmits the inferior gluteal vessels and nerves, pudendal and sciatic nerves.\nThe lesser sciatic foramen (LSF) is bounded anteriorly by the lesser sciatic notch, superiorly by the sacrospinous ligament, and postero-inferiorly by the sacrotuberous ligament.

      explanation: "Omphalocele is the total failure of the midgut to return to the peritoneal cavity during the tenth week of gestation. The contents may vary from a single loop of small bowel to the entire GI tract, including the liver. An omphalocele can be differentiated from a gastroschisis (rupture of the abdominal wall) because in an omphalocele, the herniated structures are covered by peritoneum and amnion, and the umbilical cord inserts at its apex. In gastroschisis, there is a normally positioned umbilicus and the hernia is through a paraumbilical defect. Because this (probably ischaemic) rupture of the abdominal wall occurs after the bowel has returned to the peritoneal cavity, the protruding viscera are not covered in peritoneum. The contents of the hernia in gastroschisis include stomach, midgut, and occasionally portions of the urinary tract. In omphalocele, there may be associated congenital cardiac anomalies and there is also an association with Beckwith Wiedeman syndrome.

To help characterize congenital heart disease there are a number of features to note on the radiograph as well as clinically. The presence of cyanosis excludes coarctation, which does not cause cyanosis. Truncus arteriosus (and total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR)) are associated with increased pulmonary flow, not reduced, as present in this case. Pulmonary valve atresia with an intact ventricular septum does have reduced pulmonary flow, but would present earlier than four days and the heart is typically grossly enlarged, as in this anomaly there is no forward flow of blood out of the right ventricle. D-transposition of the great arteries is classically described as giving an egg-on-a-string appearance due to the narrowed superior mediastinum caused by the abnormal rotation of the great vessels. This appearance is seldom seen as D-transposition presents early with cyanosis and is surgically corrected. The most common CXR appearance in an infant is a normal CXR.

      answer: "Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return (PAPVR)",
      explanation: "This most commonly involves the right superior pulmonary vein, but in this case involves the inferior vein. This condition may remain asymptomatic for a number of years, depending on the amount of blood that returns anomalously. PAPVR can drain into the superior vena cava (SVC), right atrium, or IVC on the right and into the brachocephalic vein or coronary sinus on the left. Scimitar syndrome is a subtype of PAPVR that is associated with ipsilateral lung hypoplasia (hence alternative name hypogenetic lung syndrome) and occasionally dextrocardia. As noted in the history, the lungs were normal. Extralobar sequestrations have aberrant pulmonary arterial supply, not present in this case. Total anomalous pulmonary venous return presents in the neonatal period, commonly with cyanosis and plethora on CXR. Patient survival depends on the presence of an ASD or PDA. No atrial abnormalities were noted to indicate cor triatriatum, although this is another disorder in the spectrum of pulmonary venous developmental anomalies",

      explanation: "This is the most common benign salivary gland tumour in children and usually appears in later childhood or adolescence. The tumour originates in the parotid gland in up to 90% of cases. Haemangiomas are the next most common benign lesion. They are usually seen in the first 6 months of life and have a female predilection. They are hypoechoic and display a variable degree of abnormal vasculature. Parotitis is usually due to mumps and results in a tender gland, which is diffusely enlarged with a heterogenous echotexture on ultrasound. Warthin tumour is a well-circumscribed cystic solid lesion, usually towards the tail of the parotid gland. It is the most common lesion to manifest as multifocal or bilateral masses. Primary lymphoma of the salivary glands is rare, but most often involves the parotid. Ultrasound will show an enlarged, diffusely infiltrated gland",

      response: "",
      answer: "Diaphyseal aclasia",
      explanation: "The description is classic for multiple hereditary osteochondromas/exostoses, also known as diaphyseal aclasia. Osteochondromas are the result of displaced growth plate cartilage, which causes lateral bone growth from the metaphysis. They typically point away from the epiphysis. There is continuity of the normal marrow, cortex, and periosteum between the exostosis and the host bone. The cartilage cap, which is the source of growth, may have some chondoid matrix, but the appearance is otherwise of a deformed but normal bone. They are normally found in the extremities, with 36% around the knee. Their growth normally ceases at skeletal maturity. Symptoms are related to pressure effects on adjacent neural or vascular structures. Less than 1% of solitary osteochondromas undergo malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma. Findings that should alert to this are destruction of exostosis bone, destruction of matrix in the cartilage cap, irregular or thick (>2 cm in adults, >3 cm in children) cap, or growth of the cap after skeletal maturity. Multiple hereditary osteochondromatosis is an uncommon autosomal dominant condition. Patients present with multiple osteochondromas, which cause short stature. The elbow and wrist joints are often deformed. There is a higher risk of malignant transformation than in solitary osteochondromas, probably 2–5%. Ollier disease is the presence of multiple enchondromas and Mafucci syndrome requires, in addition, multiple soft-tissue haemangiomas. Morquio and Hunter syndromes are mucopolysaccharidoses, with their own musculoskeletal abnormalities, which often make an appearance in exams",

      explanation: "Incomplete fusion of the Mullerian ducts results in bicornuate uterus. MRI demonstrates divergent uterine horns with an external fundal cleft that is more than 1 cm deep and an intercornual distance of more than 4 cm. In bicornuate bicollis uterus, two separate cervical canals are seen. This is distinguished from uterus didelphys by a greater degree of fusion between the horns in the lower uterine segment. Septate uterus results from incomplete septal resorption following Mullerian duct fusion. It is the most common uterine anomaly (55%). At MRI, the external fundal countour may be convex, flat, or minimally concave (less than 1 cm deep). MRI is also useful in characterizing the type (fibrous/muscular) and extent of the septum. Differentiation between bicornuate and septate uterus is important, as septate uterus is amenable to surgical management",

This is positive only if gastric mucosa is present (in approximately 20% of patients). However, ectopic gastric mucosa is present in nearly all cases of Meckel’s diverticulum that bleed, as it is the ulcerated ectopic gastric mucosa that is the source of the haemorrhage. Ectopic pancreatic and colonic mucosa can occur in a Meckel’s divericulum, but are not typically associated with haemorrhage. Ectopic thyroid tissue is not usually found in a Meckel’s diverticulum.

It is then necessary to consider the common causes of anterior mediastinal masses in children, which are: normal thymus and thymic/nodal infiltration (leukaemia, lymphoma), with other causes (lymphangioma and teratoma) being much less common. A normal thymus would not be expected to cause significant posterior displacement of the trachea.

ACC is reported to be isolated in <10% on foetal MR imaging. Sulcation delay is present in most foetuses with ACC (particularly those imaged at <30 weeks gestation), including those with good neurodevelopmental outcome, implying a global white matter dysgenesis. Periventricular nodular heterotopia and parenchymal T2WI signal hypointensity are usually seen in association with abnormal sulcal morphology.

      answer: "Achondroplasia",
      explanation: "This question tests knowledge of the severe skeletal dysplasias. Achondroplasia is the most common cause of dwarfism and is hereditary. The humeri and femora are more profoundly affected than the other long bones, although the entire skeleton is abnormal. Narrowing of the interpedicular distance as one progresses caudally down the spine is unique to this condition. Other features include a large skull with a small skull base, square iliac wings with a ‘champagne-glass’ pelvic cavity, and widened metaphyses. Thanatophoric dysplasia results in early death. Features include severe platyspondyly and ‘telephone receiver’ femora. Chondrodysplasia punctata results in stippled epiphysis and rhizomelic dwarfism. Jeune syndrome (asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy) results in respiratory distress, very short ribs, metaphyseal irregularity/beaking, and trident acetabulum.

      answer: "Enlarged ovary",
      explanation: "Ovarian torsion can occur in all age groups, with the highest prevalence in the reproductive age group. Large heavy cysts and cystic neoplasms commonly predispose to ovarian torsion. Torsion of normal ovaries is unusual but more common in adolescents. Clinical symptoms are often non-specific and therefore imaging is routinely requested. On ultrasound, an enlarged ovary is the most constant finding. The enlarged ovary may be heterogenous due to haemorrhage and oedema. Other findings include multiple small cysts aligned in the periphery of the enlarged ovary (string of pearls sign), coexistent mass, pelvic free fluid, and twisted ovarian pedicle. Benign cystic teratoma is the most common tumour predisposed to ovarian torsion. Absent arterial flow is described as the classic colour Doppler finding. However, the most frequent Doppler finding is decreased or absent venous flow with or without reduced arterial flow. A twisted ovarian pedicle with a ‘whirlpool’ sign is a useful finding on colour Doppler",

      answer: "Peutz–Jehger’s syndrome",
      explanation: "This is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance characterized by intestinal polyposis and mucocutaneous pigmentation. It is the most frequent of the polyposis syndromes to involve the small intestine. When symptomatic, the most common presentation is abdominal pain (due to small bowel intussusception in up to 50%). There may also be GI haemorrhage. There is an increased risk of malignancy of the GI tract, pancreas, and breast, even though the polyps are hamartomas. Cronkhite–Canada syndrome is non-neoplastic, non-hereditary inflammatory polyposis associated with ectodermal abnormalities. It usually occurs in the middle-aged to elderly and the polyps are more common in the stomach and colon than in the small bowel. Intussusception is not a typical presentation. Gardner syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by a triad of colonic polyposis, osteomas, and soft-tissue tumours (including desmoid tumours). Age at presentation is 15–30 years. The location of the polyps is colon (100%), duodenum (90%), stomach (5–58%), and the remainder of the small bowel (<5%). Small bowel intussusception is therefore a very rare presentation. There is a very high risk of malignant transformation of the colonic polyps if left untreated. Treatment is prophylactic total colectomy. Familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome is an autosomal dominant disease. The polyps start to appear around puberty and have a similar distribution/location to those in Gardner syndrome. Again there is a high risk of malignant transformation of these adenomatous polyps. Cowden disease is multiple hamartoma syndrome. It causes hamartomatous neoplasms of the skin and mucosa, GI tract, bones, CNS, eyes, and genitourinary tract. There may be associated malignant tumours of the breast and thyroid",

The other injuries given in the stem are also worrisome for NAI, particularly when observed in infants. Posterior rib fractures are sometimes relatively occult on plain film and scintigraphy is more sensitive. They occur when the chest is squeezed tightly, e.g. when a child is shaken. Shaking can also result in a thoraco-lumbar compression fracture. Spiral fractures of long bones are suspicious in infants, but in ambulatory children the ‘toddler’s’ spiral fracture of the tibia is common and often has no memorable preceding trauma.
